The BAC, in conjunction with the National Library Board (NLB), had established a ‘Bioethics Corner’ at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library on 30 June 2022 to promote greater awareness and understanding of bioethics in Singapore.  The ‘Bioethics Corner’, located at level 7 of the National Library Building is open to the public for access to bioethics publications. Digital collections are also available on NLB’s Overdrive platform to enhance public access to bioethics resources.
