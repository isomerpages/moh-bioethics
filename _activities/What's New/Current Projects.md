<h3>BAC's Current Projects</h3>
<p><strong>Asian Bioethics Network Conference 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>The ABN Conference 2025, taking place from 22 to 23 October at the Grand
Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, marks the first in-person gathering for ABN
members. Jointly organised by the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) and
the Centre for Biomedical Ethics at NUS (CBmE), with support from the Ministry
of Health (MOH), the conference is themed&nbsp;<em>‘Navigating the Ethical Maze for Tomorrow’s Medicine’</em>.
It will tackle the complex ethical questions emerging from rapid advancements
in healthcare—ranging from AI and digital health to issues of longevity
and the integration of traditional, complementary, and modern medical practices.
The event also serves as a key platform to strengthen regional and global
partnerships, showcase cutting-edge bioethics research, build capacity,
and identify strategic areas of focus for BAC’s ongoing work.</p>
