The BAC, in collaboration with the National Library Board (NLB), established a ‘Bioethics Corner’ at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library on 30 June 2022 to promote greater awareness and understanding of bioethics in Singapore.

The Bioethics Corner was officially launched on 29 Oct 2022 by Mr Ng Cher Pong, NLB’s Chief Executive Officer, and BAC Chair Emeritus Prof Lee Eng Hin.

The Bioethics Corner, located at level 7 of the National Library Building, is open to the public to access bioethics publications. Digital collections are also available on NLB’s Overdrive platform to enhance public access to bioethics resources.

The Bioethics Corner features a collection of about 150 physical titles related to bioethics that have been published within the last 10 years. The subjects range from topics such as big data and artificial intelligence in healthcare, assisted suicide, organ trade, CRISPR technology, and gene modification, and is inclusive of non-fiction and fiction titles. 

In addition, there is also a list of 50 digital eBook and eAudiobook bioethics-related titles available in Libby, one of NLB’s main databases for eBooks/eAudiobooks.
