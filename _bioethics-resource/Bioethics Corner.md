The BAC, in conjunction with the National Library Board (NLB), had established a ‘Bioethics Corner’ at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library on 30 June 2022 to promote greater awareness and understanding of bioethics in Singapore.

The Bioethics Corner was officially launched on 29 Oct 2022 by NLB’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ng Cher Pong, and BAC’s Chair, Emeritus Prof Lee Eng Hin.

The ‘Bioethics Corner’, located at level 7 of the National Library Building is open to the public for access to bioethics publications. Digital collections are also available on NLB’s Overdrive platform to enhance public access to bioethics resources.

The Bioethics Corner will feature a collection of about 150 physical titles related to bioethics that have been published within the last 10 years. The subjects range from topics such as Big Data and AI in healthcare, assisted suicide, organ trade, CRISPR technology, and gene modification, and is inclusive of non-fiction and fiction titles. 

In addition, there is also a list of 50 digital eBook and eAudiobook bioethics-related titles available in Libby, one of NLB’s main databases for eBooks/eAudiobooks. The titles here feature more fiction titles and the list will be refreshed quarterly to feature new titles. 

Two multimedia stations are provided near the Bioethics Corner, to encourage further exploration of the issues in bioethics using NLB’s eResources, such as databases and journals.
