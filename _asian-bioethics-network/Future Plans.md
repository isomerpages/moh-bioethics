### **Plans for 2022**

Following the inaugural Asian Bioethics Network (ABN) meeting, the BAC is currently developing an ABN webpage which will function as a digital repository for countries to share their programmes, work, and publications. 

As work is still in progress, the digital repository is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022.
