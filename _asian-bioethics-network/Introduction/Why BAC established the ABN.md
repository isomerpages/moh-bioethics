* BAC proposed the establishment of an Asian Bioethics Network to facilitate the sharing of
resources, enable knowledge exchange and help foster regional networks <br>

* Such a network would mutually benefit all participants by allowing the various committees to be kept abreast of the latest international developments in bioethics, and ensure that their
recommendations were developed in tandem with international best practices <br>

* With continued relationship building, the network participants would also be better able to
converge on ethical positions and represent the Asian perspective at international platforms<br>
