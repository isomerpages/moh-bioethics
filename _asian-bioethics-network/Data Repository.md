<p>With increasing prevalence of neurological and psychiatric disorders globally,
neuroscience research has become a priority in Singapore and many other
countries. Research efforts in the development of novel neurotechnologies
and effective treatments for such disorders have therefore become increasingly
important.</p>
<p>However, as the brain is the seat of one’s mind and underlies our thoughts,
emotions and behaviours, new neurotechnologies that study and modify the
brain have raised concerns about the potential impact of neuroscience research
on the rights and welfare of individual research subjects and patients
in the present and future.</p>

<p>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) published the first edition of <em>Ethics Guidelines for Human Biomedical Research (Guidelines)</em> in
2015. The objective of this publication was to be a one-stop resource for
researchers and members of ethics committees, or any interested individual
seeking guidance on best practices for the ethical conduct of human biomedical
research in Singapore.</p>
