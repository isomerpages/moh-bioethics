* BAC proposed the establishment of an Asian Bioethics Network to facilitate the sharing of
resources, enable knowledge exchange and help foster regional networks <br>

* Such a network would mutually benefit all participants by allowing the various committees to be kept abreast of the latest international developments in bioethics, and ensure that their
recommendations were developed in tandem with international best practices <br>

* With continued relationship building, the network participants would also be better able to
converge on ethical positions and represent the Asian perspective at international platforms<br>

* Participants at the inaugural Asian Bioethics Meeting on 10 Jun 2021 held as part
of the BAC’s 20 th Anniversary event were supportive of BAC’s proposal to
establish an Asian Bioethics Network<br>

* Meeting agreed to have regular annual or biennial meetings between members in the network<br>

* Establish a website for the Asian Bioethics Network to facilitate sharing of resources
and knowledge exchange to enable each country to share their publications, reports
and public education programmes with all other members of the network<br>
