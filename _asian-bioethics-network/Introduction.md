### **Introduction**

As biomedical sciences advance and novel therapeutics are developed, the conduct of biomedical research and the use of such new technologies raise new ethical, legal and social issues.  

Countries in Asia, though unique in many ways, share similar cultural contexts, and can benefit from one another's experience in managing bioethical issues through the establishment of an informal bioethics network to facilitate the sharing of information and resources.  

Recognising the importance and value of establishing an informal bioethics network amongst the Asian countries as well as Australia and New Zealand, the BAC initiated the formation of the Asian Bioethics Network (ABN) in 2021 to:  
1. Foster regional networks and present consolidated views that better represent the perspectives of shared Asian values and needs;  
2. Facilitate sharing of bioethics resources and programmes and to exchange information and knowledge among the countries; and  
3. Ensure that the value and importance of bioethics are carried into future generations.  
		
The ABN aims to be collaborative and complements the WHO's Asia-Pacific National Ethics Committee (APNEC) network as well as the UNESCO Bioethics Programme by providing a platform for Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand to share ethical views from their unique cultural perspectives and discuss collaborations with one another.
