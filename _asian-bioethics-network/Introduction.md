### **Introduction**

Asian countries, together with Australia and New Zealand, though unique in many ways, share similar cultural contexts, and can benefit from one another's experiences in tackling bioethical issues.  

Recognising the value of establishing an informal network amongst such countries, the BAC initiated the formation of the Asian Bioethics Network (ABN) in 2021 to:  

1. To foster regional networks and achieve a more consolidated front at international bioethics events that better represent the perspectives of shared Asian values and needs; 
2. To facilitate sharing of bioethics resources and programmes and to exchange information and knowledge among the countries; and 
3. To ensure that the value and importance of bioethics are carried into future generations

The ABN aims to be collaborative and complement the WHO's Asia-Pacific National Ethics Committee (APNEC) network as well as UNESCO's Bioethics Programme in providing a platform for Asian countries to share ethical views from their unique cultural perspectives and discuss collaborations with one another.

### **Plans for 2022**

As discussed at the 10 June 2021 meeting, the BAC is currently working on developing an ABN webpage which will function as a digital repository for countries to share their programmes, work, and publications with one another. This digital repository is currently in development and will be completed in 2022.
