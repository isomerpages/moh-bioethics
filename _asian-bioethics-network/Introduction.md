### **Introduction**

Biomedical research continues to progress rapidly globally. As biomedical sciences advance and novel therapeutics are discovered, the conduct of biomedical research and the use of such new technologies will raise new ethical, legal and social issues.  

Asian countries, together with Australia and New Zealand, though unique in many ways, share similar cultural contexts, and can benefit from one another's experiences in managing bioethical issues.  

Recognising the value of establishing an informal network amongst such countries, the BAC initiated the formation of the Asian Bioethics Network (ABN) in 2021 to:  
1. To foster regional networks and present consolidated views that better represent the perspectives of shared Asian values and needs;  
2. To facilitate sharing of bioethics resources and programmes and to exchange information and knowledge among the countries; and  
3. To ensure that the value and importance of bioethics are carried into future generations.  
		
The ABN aims to be collaborative and complements the WHO's Asia-Pacific National Ethics Committee (APNEC) network as well as UNESCO's Bioethics Programme in providing a platform for Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand to share ethical views from their unique cultural perspectives and discuss collaborations with one another.
