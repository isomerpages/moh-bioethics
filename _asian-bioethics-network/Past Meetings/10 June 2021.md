### **First Asian Bioethics Network Meeting held on 10 June 2021**

**Summary of Inaugural Meeting**

* The first Asian Bioethics Network (ABN) meeting was held on 10 June 2021 in conjunction with BAC's 20th Anniversary Event, which also comprised a virtual public conference held  on 17 and 18 June 2021.  
* The ABN meeting was chaired by Mr Charles Lim, BAC member and Singapore's representative to UNESCOâ€™s Intergovernmental Bioethics Committee (IGBC) for the 2018-2021 term.
* At the meeting, the BAC shared its proposal to establish the Asian Bioethics Network, and also invited representatives from different Asian countries to share their national bioethics committees' work, achievements, latest developments, as well as emerging bioethical issues in their countries. 
* The attendees agreed that countries will need to continue building capacity for their respective research ethics committees and researchers by strengthening research governance, revising guidelines and drafting new guidelines and regulations in light of latest scientific advancements and technological developments, as well as educating stakeholders on bioethical issues (e.g. public, media, students). 
* Attendees also shared that ethical issues arising from genomics and other emerging technologies and ethical issues involved in assisted reproduction as well as research using surplus human eggs, sperm and embryos would be some of the emerging bioethical issues that national ethics committees will need to study and review in the near future. These studies and reviews should place special focus on vulnerable populations in different setting.
* The attendees agreed to the BAC's proposal to establish the Asian Bioethics Network as it would facilitate the sharing of resources, enable knowledge exchange and help foster regional networks. This would mutually benefit all network members by allowing the various committees to be kept abreast of the latest international developments in bioethics, and ensure that their recommendations were developed in tandem with international best practices. With continued relationship-building, the network members would also be better able to converge on ethical positions and represent the Asian perspective at international platforms.
