### **First Asian Bioethics Network Meeting held on 10 June 2021**

**Summary of Meeting**
* The first Asian Bioethics Network Meeting was held in conjunction with BAC's 20th Anniversary Event, which comprises pre-conference meetings and a virtual public conference held in Jun 2021.  The pre-conference meetings provided the BAC an opportunity to review its ongoing work initiatives, discuss future plans, and ensure that it can continue to fulfil its main role and function and raise awareness on the importance of bioethics in future generations.  
* The meeting was chaired by Mr Charles Lim, BAC member and Singapore's representative to the IGBC for the 2018-2021 term.  
* At the meeting, the BAC shared its proposal for establishing the Asian Bioethics Network, and also heard representatives from the different countries share their national bioethics committees' work, achievements, latest developments, as well as emerging bioethical issues in their countries.  
* The meeting was supportive of BAC's proposal to establish an Asian Bioethics Network and agreed to:  
    1. Hold regular meetings between members in the network  
    2. Establish a website to facilitate sharing of resources and knowledge exchange to enable each country to share their publications, reports and public education programmes with other members of the network  
* Singapore's BAC will take lead in establishing the Asian Bioethics Network website.
