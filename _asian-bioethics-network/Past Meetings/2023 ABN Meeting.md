### **Second Asian Bioethics Network Meeting held on 4 Sep 2023**

**Summary of Second Meeting**

* The second Asian Bioethics Network (ABN) meeting was held on 4 Sep 2023 with the theme "**Emerging Ethical Challenges of Healthcare Digitalisation**".  
* The ABN meeting was chaired by Emeritus Professor Lee Eng Hin, Chair of the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) and Emeritus Professor Roy Joseph, Chair of the National Medical Ethics Committee (NMEC).
* The ABN has expanded considerably from eight member states in June 2021 and currently comprises 14 members from Asia, Australia and New Zealand. This indicates strong support and interest from our regional counterparts in exchanging bioethics experiences and furthering capabilities.
* Representatives from different Asian countries were invited to share on their national bioethics committees' work, major achievements, and bioethics initiatives in their countries. They also shared on the state of healthcare digitalisation in their countries as well as the emerging technologies, benefits, ethical challenges faced and the plans/recommendations to address the challenges. 
* The meeting also featured two keynote presentations by Associate Professor Ngiam Kee Yuan, Group Chief Technology Officer, National University Health System and Professor Julian Savulescu, Director, Centre for Biomedical Ethics, and Chen Su Lan Centennial Professor in Medical Ethics, National University of Singapore.
