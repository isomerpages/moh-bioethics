<p><strong>RELEASE OF A REPORT BY THE BIOETHICS ADVISORY COMMITTEE</strong>
</p>
<p>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) announces the release of a Report
entitled: “Personal Information in Biomedical Research”. This Report discusses
the ethical issues relating to the use of personal information in biomedical
research and makes recommendations on the appropriate use of such information
through the provision of proper safeguards.</p>
<p>The use of personal information is essential for biomedical research.
It has produced valuable medical knowledge which in turn has improved healthcare.
However, with the wide use of such information and rapid advances in information
technology, there is a need for proper rules governing the access to, and
use of, personal information and a secure system of information protection.
The Report calls for a framework to protect privacy and confidentiality
and allow legitimate use and exchange of information for research. A statutory
framework is essential if researchers in Singapore are to collaborate with
researchers from other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Eleven recommendations are made, based on the following ethical principles:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Autonomy – where individuals are deemed to be entitled to decide, in general,
their participation in research, and their informed consent needs to be
sought;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proportionality – the protection to be offered and the information to
be provided to research participants should be in proportion to any risk
of harm;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reciprocity – the principle that in benefiting from past research, individuals
should consider participating in future research if it poses little or
no risk of harm to them; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protection of privacy – the view that individuals are entitled to privacy,
and that they can legitimately expect that their personal particulars and
information will be treated with proper respect and kept confidential,
should they participate in research or should their personal information
be used in research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal Information, which is considered to be any information about
an individual can be divided into two main categories:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Identified personal information: Information where identifying particulars
are included, so that the identity of the individual is known, for example,
in a medical record;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>De-identified personal information, comprising:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reversibly de-identified personal information, in which identifying particulars
have been separated from the information, and a code or system of codes
or encryption substituted, so that the identity of the person becomes unknown
but could be restored using the codes or reversing the encryption; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irreversibly de-identified personal information, which is information
that has been permanently stripped of identifying details and thus cannot
be used to identify an individual.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers must prevent breaches of privacy and are encouraged to manage
personal information, especially sensitive information, as de-identified
information as far as possible. There are other security safeguards that
may be employed to protect against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure,
copying, use and modification of data.</p>
<p>Generally the use of personal information in biomedical research requires
the consent of the individual concerned and the approval of an IRB. Requesting
consent is not just a matter of providing information. It is a matter of
explaining what is proposed in a way and at a level appropriate to the
intending participant and in proportion to any risk of harm in participating.</p>
<p>Public health research and disease registries collect patient information,
analyse the data and report incidence, pattern and trends of diseases,
work which is critical for the formulation of public health policies, programme
planning and research in general. The Report recommends that medical information
should be disclosed to national disease registries, without requiring the
prior consent of patients, as is done in a number of other scientifically
advanced countries, for example the UK (cancer registries) and Sweden.
Care should be taken to keep such data confidential.</p>
<p>Similarly, the study of patients’ medical records has engendered much
valuable medical knowledge. However, obtaining consent is not always practicable
and there is minimal risk of harm to the patients concerned. Therefore,
the BAC recommends that IRBs be legally empowered to waive patient consent
requirement in situations where the research involves only the use of medical
records, with no patient contact and privacy and confidentiality are not
in any way compromised.</p>
<p>BAC Chairman, Professor Lim Pin says: “It is no secret that Singapore
aims to be a world class hub for biomedical science. Research participation
and use of personal information in biomedical research are necessary to
achieve this aim. There are types of research that have important public
health justification with minimal risk of harm. An example is research
into factors affecting health and disease in populations (epidemiology).
After careful consideration, the BAC felt that it is ethically acceptable
for personal information to be used in such research without consent, provided
that privacy and confidentiality safeguards are in place. The safeguards
set out in this Report should assure the public that their privacy and
the confidentiality of their personal information are adequately protected.”</p>
<p>The Report also considers concerns that arise in taking consent for research
from vulnerable persons (such as children and adolescents, the mentally
impaired or those, like National Service men, who might experience pressure
to conform). When reviewing research proposals, IRBs should ensure that
any concerns in regard to vulnerable persons are appropriately addressed,
and data from such persons should enjoy the same privacy and confidentiality
as for any other persons.</p>
<p>The Report also makes clear that research participants be informed of
procedures for withdrawal and should be able to withdraw consent at any
time without explanation or prejudice.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Report discusses the limits to the right of access to predictive
genetic or other medical information by employers and insurers. In the
case of insurers a general moratorium on such access is recommended, following
the example of the UK, until issues of how such information could be used
are sufficiently considered by both government and the insurance industry.</p>
<p><strong>LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The Legal Protection of Personal Protection</strong>
</p>
<p>We recommend that the relevant authorities consider establishing a comprehensive
statutory framework relating to the use and protection of personal information
in biomedical research.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy and Confidential</strong>
</p>
<p>Personal information used for research should be de-identified as far
and as early as possible and should be stored or transferred as de-identified
information.</p>
<p>Researchers should take adequate measures to prevent inadvertent identification
of individuals. Should an individual be identified inadvertently from de-identified
information, the confidentiality and privacy rights of this individual
are not abrogated by such identification, and steps should be taken to
reinstate and secure them.</p>
<p>Irreversibly de-identified personal information need not be subject to
privacy and confidentiality requirements.</p>
<p>Privacy and confidentiality safeguards should be commensurate with the
potential risk of harm from disclosure, and should be proportional to the
sensitivity of the information and the kind of research being carried out.
When reversibly de-identified information is used for research, IRBs should
consider the adequacy of the extent and means of the de-identification
in proportion to the risk.</p>
<p><strong>Consent and Proportionality</strong>
</p>
<p>Specific consent should be obtained for sensitive research or when the
research involves identified personal information or tissue samples. General
consent should be a sufficient requirement for subsequent unspecified research
involving the use of de-identified information or de-identified surplus
or stored tissues. The information to be provided to the individual when
taking consent should depend on and be proportional to the sensitivity
of the research and the risk of harm.</p>
<p><strong>Consent and Reciprocity</strong>
</p>
<p>We recommend that the relevant authorities clarify the legal basis for
the disclosure of medical information to national disease registries by
physicians; and establish mechanisms enabling national registries and healthcare
institutions to facilitate the use of personal information held or controlled
by them for biomedical research that can significantly advance the public
good, while safeguarding privacy.</p>
<p>We recommend that IRBs be legally empowered to waive the patient consent
requirement for research involving only the use of medical records, while
ensuring patient privacy and confidentiality of medical information.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerable Persons</strong>
</p>
<p>We recommend that IRBs, when reviewing research proposals, ensure that
any concerns in regard to vulnerable persons are appropriately addressed
although researchers should always respect the nature of such data and
treat it with sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal of Consent</strong>
</p>
<p>Research participants should be allowed to withdraw their consent to participate
in the research at any time without explanation and without prejudice,
and should be informed of the procedure for withdrawal and its implications
when consent is sought.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Predictive Genetic Information by Employers and Insurers</strong>
</p>
<p>We recommend that the government consider implementing a moratorium on
the use of predictive genetic information for insurance purposes, consider
the long-term implications of the accessibility of predictive genetic test
results by employers and the insurance industry, and monitor developments
in this area.</p>
