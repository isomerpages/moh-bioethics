_NLB partnered the Bioethics Advisory Committee to bring in books on areas like Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, organ transplants and genetic manipulation._


The National Library Board (NLB) launched the new Bioethics Corner at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library on Saturday (Oct 29).

Created in partnership with the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC), the Bioethics Corner offers over 160 titles on ethical issues in areas such as Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, surrogacy, organ transplants and genetic manipulation.

Key titles added to the Bioethics Corner include _Birth of Intelligence: From RNA to Artificial Intelligence, Predictive Medicine: Artificial Intelligence and its impact on healthcare business strategy_ and _Data analytics for Pandemics: A Covid-19 Case Study_.

More than 13,600 books and 5,500 e-books on bioethics are also available on [NLB’s mobile application](https://libbyapp.com/interview/locate-library/resolve?key=nlb&realm=library#resolveLibraryFromAttributes). BAC and NLB will continue to add titles over the next three years, in line with the latter’s Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025 ([LAB25](https://youthopia.sg/read/central-public-library-and-marina-parade-public-library-to-undergo-revamp-as-part-of-lab25/)).

“This is an area of emerging importance and interest among our patrons, and we are glad to partner the Bioethics Advisory Committee to offer such materials for everyone to discover and learn from.” said NLB’s CEO Mr Ng Cher Pong.
