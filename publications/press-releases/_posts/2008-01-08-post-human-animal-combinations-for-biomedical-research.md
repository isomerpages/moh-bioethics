<p><strong>Release of a public Consultation Paper by the BAC</strong>
</p>
<p>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) announces the release of a Consultation
Paper entitled “Human-Animal Combinations for Research". Human-animal combinations
are entities resulting from the mixing of genes, cells or tissue of human
origin with those of other species. The Paper discusses the ethical, legal
and social issues arising from the creation and use of such entities for
research.</p>
<p>The Consultation Paper is part of BAC’s effort to update and consolidate
its recommendations for human stem cell research. The BAC considers such
research to have considerable potential in the treatment of currently incurable
diseases, such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
While there have been significant advances in stem cell science and technology,
research involving human-animal combinations is required for further progress,
especially if we are to avoid reliance on increasing donations of human
eggs for research.</p>
<p>The terms 'chimera' and 'hybrid' have been used to describe different
types of human-animal combinations. Scientifically speaking, a chimera
is any animal or human whose body contains cells, tissue or organs from
another animal or human. For instance, the introduction of tissue from
a human individual into an animal or another human individual would result
in the creation of a chimera. A hybrid, on the other hand, is an organism
whose cells contain genetic material from two or more different species.
An example of a hybrid is a mule, which is created through the fertilisation
of a horse’s egg with a donkey’s sperm. Another type of hybrid is the ‘cytoplasmic
hybrid embryo’, where the nucleus (genetic material) of a somatic cell
is transferred into an egg whose nucleus has been removed. This technique
is called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT).</p>
<p>Certain limited kinds of human-animal combinations are useful in stem
cell research for several reasons. Some are chimeras created in vitro through
the introduction of human stem cells into animal embryos, foetuses or post-natal
animals. Using them, scientists are able to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>test the development potential of human stem cells or their derivatives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the potential usefulness and safety of transplanting human stem
cells for clinical treatment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>study the possibility of growing human tissues and organs in animals for
the purpose of transplantation into humans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, scientists have proposed creating cytoplasmic hybrid embryos
as this would allow them to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>study the processes involved in nuclear reprogramming (or how the nucleus
of an adult specialised cell can be induced to regain its potential to
develop into other types of cells). A recent reported advance in reprogramming
adult cells into cells with properties similar to embryonic stem cells
complements such research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>derive disease-specific stem cells for studying specific disease mechanisms
and methods of treatment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>avoid the use of human eggs, which are a limited and ethically contentious
resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Research involving human-animal combinations has nevertheless raised several
concerns. Some people say that there are health and safety risks pertaining
to such research, for example, the risk of bringing about new strains of
viruses and bacteria. In addition, there are those who have expressed religious
and ethical concerns, which include arguments to the effect that the creation
of these combinations is repugnant and amounts to 'playing God'.</p>
<p>One can ask if the concerns are so overwhelming that they would justify
a partial or complete prohibition? Or would monitoring such research sufficiently
address the concerns? A number of countries such as the UK and Canada have
considered the matter and have allowed such research but under legal and
regulatory purview. The situation in Singapore has yet to be decided, and
the main objective of the Consultation Paper is to invite researchers,
professionals, religious bodies, interested organisations and the general
public to comment on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the creation and use of these human-animal combinations for research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the prohibitions, limits and regulatory mechanisms that should apply to
such research in Singapore; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other matter related to human-animal combinations for biomedical research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Professor Lee Eng Hin, Chairman of the Human Embryo and Chimera Working
Group, says: “Although the testing of human embryonic stem cells in animals
is a relatively new area for biomedical research, human-animal combinations
have existed for decades and there are many examples. While many people
may not realise this, any individual who received a xenotransplant in the
form of a pig’s heart value is by definition, a chimera. Since 1962, nude
mice have been used in research to test the properties of human cancer
cells. The transgenic mouse with human cancer genes, which was created
in the late 1980s, has allowed scientists to study the early development
of tumours. These advancements in science have expanded our knowledge regarding
human diseases and such knowledge might eventually lead to the development
of new medical treatments and cures.”</p>
<p>Professor Lim Pin, Chairman of the BAC, added: “Even though the wide use
of human-animal combinations in research underscores the confidence in
the benefits that they would bring about, there are certain ethical boundaries
to the conduct of such research. For instance, even if possible, it would
be ethically unacceptable for scientists to create sub-human creatures
with potentially human consciousness. Furthermore, scientists overwhelmingly
do want to conduct research in a way that is ethical. The outcome of this
public consultation will be useful in giving guidance to the scientific
community here.”</p>
<p>The views of the public and interested parties will assist the BAC in
formulating recommendations on research involving human-animal combinations.

<h3><strong>About the BAC</strong></h3>
<p>The BAC was established by the Government in December 2000 to address
the ethical, legal and social issues arising from human biomedical research
and its applications. It develops and recommends policies on these issues,
with the aim of protecting the rights and welfare of individuals, while
allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realise its full potential
for the benefit of mankind.</p>
