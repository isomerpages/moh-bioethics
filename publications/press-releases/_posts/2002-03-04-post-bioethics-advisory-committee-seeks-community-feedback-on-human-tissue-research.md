<p><strong>Consultation paper distributed to 66 community groups in Singapore, including religious, medical and public interest groups to obtain their views</strong>
</p>
<p>Since its appointment in December 2000, the Bioethics Advisory Committee
(BAC) has formed three Subcommittees to focus on the specific issues of
Human Stem Cell Research, Human Genetics, and Publicity. In particular,
the Human Genetics Subcommittee (HGS) was formed to address the ethical,
legal and social issues arising specifically from human genetics research
in Singapore. The list of Human Genetics Subcommittee members is attached
in Annexe 1 for your reference.</p>
<p>Over the past months, the HGS has considered and debated relevant scientific,
ethical and legal issues arising in the field of human tissue banking and
research. This was achieved through consultation with local experts, commissioned
papers, and internal deliberations. In its paper, the HGS also considered
and took into account positions and guidelines already adopted or recommended
in other leading jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The HGS has prepared a consultation paper entitled "Human Tissue Research".
In this paper, the HGS addresses and advances interim recommendations on
some of the more pressing issues in the field of human tissue banking and
research in Singapore.</p>
<p>The paper covers the following key issues relating to human tissue research
and human tissue banking:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ethical and legal concerns, in particular, with regards to the use of
human tissue in research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethical guidelines governing the taking of human tissue samples, and for
research access to such samples;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related issues of confidentiality and consent in the usage of human tissues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proper framework for the operational governance of human tissue banking
in Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Said Associate Professor Terry Kaan, Chairman of the Human Genetics Subcommittee:
"Research on human tissue underpins much of the advances in the biomedical
sciences which have contributed so much to our health and well-being. For
instance, a great deal of what we know about various forms of cancers have
been derived from research on human tissue. Through such research, important
discoveries in the prevention, control and treatment of such diseases have
been made, and continue to be made, for the benefit of humankind". Associate
Professor Kaan added that "As we have pointed out in our Report, human
tissue research is likely to assume a more important role in the future
as new uses for the information derived from human tissue research are
discovered. Most notably, almost all forms of genetic and genomic research
use human tissue, directly or indirectly, as the starting point of their
investigations. It is therefore important that an effective legal and ethical
framework is developed to allow the full potential of human tissue research
to be tapped, while at the same time, to ensure that the rights of individuals
are protected through the establishment of appropriate ethical guidelines
and standards for the conduct of human tissue banking and research."</p>
<p>The consultation paper was distributed to 66 organisations on Wednesday,
;27 February 2002, and the respective organisations have been requested
to submit their feedback to the BAC by 13 March 2002. The HGS also invites
and welcomes feedback from the public on the issues concerning human tissue
research. Those interested to obtain a copy of the consultation paper and/
or to submit feedback may write to the BAC Secretariat at 250 North Bridge
Road, #15-01/02 Raffles City Tower, Singapore 179101. Alternatively, the
Secretariat can also be reached by email at contactus@bioethics-singapore.gov.sg.
The BAC expects to prepare recommendations on these issues for the Life
Sciences Ministerial Committee in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) was appointed by the Government
in December 2000 to address the ethical, legal and social issues arising
from research on human biology and behaviour, and its applications. It
is chaired by Prof Lim Pin, University Professor at the National University
of Singapore's (NUS) Faculty of Medicine. The BAC is charged to develop
and recommend policies to the Life Sciences Ministerial Committee on these
issues, with the aim of protecting the rights and welfare of individuals,
while allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realize its full
potential for the benefit of mankind.</p>
