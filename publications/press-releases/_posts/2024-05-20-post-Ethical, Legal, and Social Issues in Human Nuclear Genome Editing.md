<h2><strong>PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL ISSUES ARISING FROM HUMAN NUCLEAR GENOME EDITING</strong></h2>
<p>1. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) is conducting a public consultation
to seek views and feedback on the ethical, legal, and social issues arising
from the use of Human Nuclear Genome Editing (HNGE) technologies in biomedical
research, clinical research, and healthcare. The consultation will be conducted
from <strong>3 June 2024 to 13 August 2024 </strong>and the consultation
paper can be accessed from <a href="https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BAC website</a> or <a href="https://www.reach.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REACH Portal</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Ethical Challenges of HNGE applications in biomedical and clinical research, and healthcare</strong></h3>
<p>2. In recent years advances in HNGE technologies have resulted in the
discovery of more precise tools that hold great promise in advancing human
biomedical research and clinical translation, with the potential to improve
human health. HNGE technologies in human biomedical research have facilitated
developments in genetics, disease modelling and therapeutics. The use of
non-heritable gene editing<sup>1</sup> holds promise for treating genetic
disorders, infertility, enhancing personalised medicine and improving health
outcomes. While HNGE technologies have the potential to confer resistance
to diseases and enhance traits in the future, they also raise ethical issues
such as unintended consequences and long-term effects on individuals and
future generations, resulting in social inequalities, and other issues
on consent. Maintaining a balance between scientific innovation and ethical
responsibility remains a challenge in navigating the complex landscape
of HNGE.</p>
<h3><strong>Scope and Aim of Consultation</strong></h3>
<p>3. Recognising these ethical challenges, the BAC has developed a public
consultation paper titled ‘Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues arising from
Human Nuclear Genome Editing’ to discuss the ethical issues from the use
of HNGE technologies in biomedical and clinical research and other potential
clinical applications. These include issues on mosaicism, off-target effects,
long-term safety, equitable access, the broad effect of genetic enhancement
on society, and how the HNGE governance framework can be implemented in
Singapore. The paper also discusses the ethical principles underpinning
the applications of HNGE, such as <em>respect for persons</em>, <em>solidarity<sup>2</sup></em>, <em>justice</em>, <em>proportionality<sup>3</sup></em>, <em>sustainability</em>,
and <em>responsible stewardship of science<sup>4</sup></em>. The paper is
intended to guide academics, researchers, healthcare professionals, research
and healthcare institutions, Clinical Ethics Committees (CECs) and Institutional
Review Boards (IRBs) on the ethical use of HNGE applications in human biomedical
research, clinical research, and healthcare.</p>
<p>4. The paper builds upon previous BAC reports and recommendations, referencing
relevant legislation/Acts such as the Human Biomedical Research Act (2015),
the Human Cloning and Other Prohibited Practices Act (2004), and the Healthcare
Services Act (2020).</p>
<p>5. Through the public consultation, the BAC aims to gather inputs from
academics, researchers, research and healthcare institutions, healthcare
professionals, professional bodies and societies, CECs, IRBs, religious
organisations, industry partners, and the public on key ethical questions
and issues discussed in the consultation paper. Please refer to <strong><u>Annex A</u></strong> for
the outline of key ethical questions and issues raised in the consultation
paper.</p>
<p>6. The views of the public, academic, research, and healthcare institutions,
CECs, IRBs, professional bodies and societies, religious organisations,
and other interested organisations will assist the BAC in developing its
recommendations.</p>
<h3><strong>Period of Consultation</strong></h3>
<p>7. The public consultation will last for a period of two months from <strong>3 June 2024 to 13 August 2024. </strong>All
comments should be sent and reach the BAC by <strong><u>13 August</u></strong><u> </u><strong><u>2024</u></strong>.</p>

<h3><strong><u>ANNEX A</u></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>[Invitation To Comment] Public Consultation Paper: Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues Arising from Human Nuclear Genome Editing</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>a. Mosaicism<sup>5</sup>, Off-Target Effects, and On-Target Undesirable Modifications</strong></h4>
<p>1. Gene editing technologies could enable corrections to the genomic sequence
to rectify or remove mutations that lead to adverse health conditions.
Such technologies could also lead to unintended biological outcomes such
as chromosomal mosaicism in embryos, and undesirable consequences (e.g.,
development of cancer and allergic reactions) arising from off-target mutations
and deletions.</p>
<h4><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong></h4>
<p><em>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should researchers and clinicians balance the potential benefits of gene editing technologies against the risks associated with mosaicism and off-target effects?</em>
</p>
<p><em>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies ensure that patients or participants undergoing non-heritable gene editing interventions are fully informed of the risks associated with such applications?</em>
</p>
<p><em>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should clinical applications of heritable gene editing be allowed, such as for the treatment of diseases or infertility, given the possibility that future generations may potentially suffer from unintended consequences associated with such applications?</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>b. Safety and Long-Term Effects of HNGE</strong></h4>
<p>2. Gene editing may potentially offer new ways of treating genetic disorders,
infertility, enhancing personalised medicine and improving health outcomes.
However, it has not yet seen widespread use in clinical practice nor evaluated
over long periods of time in humans as the technology is still in its early
phase of development and there are concerns regarding the safety and long-term
side effects of the technology on individuals receiving the treatment.</p>
<h4><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong></h4>
<p><em>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should researchers, research institutions, and clinicians ensure favourable risk-benefit ratio is achieved for patients or participants undergoing clinical trials or clinical interventions involving non-heritable gene editing?</em>
</p>
<p><em>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can researchers do to mitigate challenges and alleviate long-term consequences associated with non-heritable gene editing to ensure responsible stewardship of science?</em>
</p>
<p><em>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should clinical applications of heritable gene editing be allowed, given the difficulty in predicting the long-term consequences of such applications on future generations?</em>
</p>
<p><em>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the ethical challenges involved in conducting follow-up studies to determine the long-term side effects of gene editing interventions in research participants?</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>c. Procurement and Use of Human Embryos and Oocytes in HNGE Research</strong></h4>
<p>3. Regulated research with human embryos have greatly enhanced knowledge
about human gene function and early embryonic development, as well as advanced
research on infertility, genetic diseases, and intractable diseases. While
procuring oocytes with the desired genotype from individuals can enable
researchers to study gene mutations in embryos for a given disease-causing
gene, or to evaluate the treatment for a specific gene mutation, it may
lead to health risks for donors during the oocyte extraction procedure.
Another ethical issue involved in the use of embryos for gene editing research
is potential privacy breach.</p>
<h4><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;<em>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do researchers and research institutions weigh the potential benefits of gene editing research on human embryos and oocytes against the ethical and safety concerns?</em>
</p>
<p><em>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can regulatory authorities do to ensure that embryo or oocyte donors are not receiving any inducement but fairly reciprocated for their contributions to gene editing research?</em>
</p>
<p><em>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can researchers and research institutions do to ensure that the dignity and rights and privacy and confidentiality of individuals who donate embryos or oocytes are protected?</em>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>d. Equitable Access and Allocation of Resources</strong></h4>
<p>4. Gene editing technologies extend beyond discovering and developing
therapies, particularly for rare genetic disorders, severe diseases such
as cancer, and treatment of infertility. These technologies can also be
used for enhancing specific traits. However, as with many new modalities
in medicine, gene editing technologies could be prohibitively expensive
and would give rise to concerns of inequitable access by those who are
in need but cannot afford them.</p>
<h4><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;<em>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the ethical considerations in ensuring equitable access to gene editing technologies?</em>
</p>
<p><em>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we ensure equitable access to gene editing technologies across different socio-economic groups and regions?</em>
</p>
<p><em>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can researchers and research institutions encourage more Asian participation in clinical trials for gene editing technologies to ensure inclusivity?</em>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<h4><strong>e. Genetic Enhancement and the Effects on Society</strong></h4>
<p>5. Recent advances have increased the possibility that gene editing can
also be used for purposes that go beyond therapies and medical interventions,
and the possible applications of gene editing technologies include genetic
enhancement in areas such as conferring resistance to diseases and enhancement
of physical attributes and cognitive abilities. Such potential clinical
applications of gene editing technologies raise several ethical issues.</p>
<h4><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><em>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the ethical considerations involved in using gene editing technologies for genetic enhancement?</em>
</p>
<p><em>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How might potential clinical applications of gene editing for genetic enhancement impact future generations?</em>
</p>
<p><em>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we allow clinical applications of gene editing for genetic enhancement?</em>
</p>
<p><em>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can be done to ensure that gene editing technologies are used responsibly and ethically?</em>
</p>

<h4><strong>Footnotes</strong></h4>
<p><sup>1</sup>Non-heritable gene editing involves making genetic changes
to somatic cells, and including all cells in the body that are not involved
in reproduction. As a result, changes made to these cells cannot be inherited
by any children of the person receiving the treatment.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup><em>Solidarity</em> reflects the willingness and moral obligations
of individuals to share the costs associated with research participation,
such as potential risks, in return for the common good.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup><em>Proportionality</em> requires that the risk in any acceptable
programme of research, and the stringency of its regulation, should not
be disproportionate to any anticipated benefits.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup><em>Responsible stewardship of science</em> refers to the moral
requirement to be prudent about the resources and having oversight of all
elements responsibly, including planning, management, and decision-making
in research activities&nbsp;&nbsp; in the pursuit of any emerging field
in biomedical research.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Mosaicism is a condition that occurs when a person has two
or more sets of cells that differ genetically from one another. For example,
a person with this condition might possess some cells that have 46 chromosomes
while other cells have 47 chromosomes.</p>
