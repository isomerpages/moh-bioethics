**Ethical, Legal and Social Issues Arising from 'Big Data and Artificial Intelligence' (AI) in Human Biomedical Research**

1\. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) has issued a public consultation paper on the ethical, legal and social issues arising from 'Big Data and AI' in human biomedical research, and invites public feedback on the potential issues related to the use of big data and AI applications in biomedical research. 

2\. The views of the public and interested organisations will assist the BAC in formulating its recommendations for its advisory report which will guide academics, researchers, healthcare professionals, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in the ethical use of big data and AI applications in biomedical research. It will also provide ethical guidance to policy and decision-makers, as well as support the safe growth of AI in biomedical and healthcare research.  

3\. The report complements other big data and AI reports and ethical guidelines such as the ‘Ethics Framework for Big Data in Health and Research’ by the Science, Health, and Policy-relevant Ethics in Singapore (SHAPES) working group and the AI in Healthcare Guidelines (AIHGle) co-developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS).

4\. The public consultation will take place for about 9 weeks from 26 Apr 2023 to 27 Jun 2023.

10\. To facilitate discussions, BAC will be organising the following dialogue sessions:
* (i) Public dialogue session on 28 April 2018 (Saturday), 2:00pm to 4:00pm,at The Pod, National Library, Level 16 (100 Victoria Street, Singapore 188064)
* (ii) Dialogue session with researchers, clinicians and members of institutional ethics review boards, on 10 May 2018 (Thursday), 12:00pm to 2:00pm, at HarbourFront Centre, #09-66 (1 Maritime Square,Singapore 099253). Those interested to attend can contact the BAC Secretariat at bioethics_singapore@moh.gov.sg. 

11\. The BAC welcomes feedback on the issues discussed in the consultation paper, or any other aspects of big data and AI. All comments should be sent by 27 June 2023:

<br><sup>[1]</sup> Mitochondria are tiny organelles that are responsible for energy production in the cell. Faulty mitochondria can have serious debilitating effects. Please see the Annex for more information on mitochondrial disorders.
<br><sup>[2]</sup> Most of the cell’s DNA is located in its nucleus. However, a small amount of DNA is found in the mitochondria. The former is known as nuclear DNA, and the latter mitochondrial DNA.

ANNEX

**About the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC)**
<br>The BAC is an independent advisory committee that was established by the Government in December 2000 to address the ethical, legal and social issues arising from human biomedical research and its applications. BAC studies emerging areas in human biomedical research, and develops and recommends policies to the government as appropriate, with the aim of protecting the rights and welfare of individuals, while allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realise its full potential for the benefit of mankind.

**What are Mitochondrial Disorders?**
<br>Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are tiny organelles found within the cytoplasm of the cell, and are mainly responsible for energy production through a process known as aerobic respiration. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from DNA abnormalities in the mitochondrial genome. Owing to its central role in cellular energy production, mitochondrial disorders often cause debilitating effects on highly energy-dependent organs and tissues including the brain (encephalopathy), the heart (cardiomyopathy), and other muscles (myopathy). Symptoms and severity vary widely amongst patients, depending on the ratio of dysfunctional to normal mitochondria in the cell, and the energy demands of the affected organ(s). There is currently no cure for mitochondrial disorders, though many of the symptoms are treatable.
