<p><strong>Release of a report by the Bioethics Advisory Committee</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) announces the release of a report
entitled “Human-Animal Combinations in Stem Cell Research". The term “human-animal
combinations” refers to any kind of living organism in which there is some
mixing of human and animal materials. The Report focuses on two types of
human-animal combinations: cytoplasmic hybrids and animal chimeras.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cytoplasmic hybrid is created by injecting the nucleus (genetic material)
of a somatic cell from a human body into an enucleated animal egg. This
technique, called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), allows disease-specific
or patient-specific stem cells to be derived in order to study nuclear
reprogramming and to understand genetic diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animal chimeras are produced by injecting human stem cells into animals
at various stages of development. Such chimeras are needed in research
to study stem cell biology, as well as to find new and more effective ways
to treat diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In view of increasing ethical debate on research involving human-animal
combinations internationally, a working group was formed by the BAC in
2006 to consider the ethical, legal and social issues that may arise should
researchers seek to conduct such research in Singapore. This initiative
is also part of the BAC’s effort to update its recommendations for human
stem cell research, especially in the light of recent developments. The
BAC expects stem cell research to have considerable potential in the treatment
of currently incurable diseases, such as spinal cord injury, diabetes,
Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Clinical trials of stem cell
treatments are beginning in a number of countries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scientific rationale behind the creation of such human-animal combinations
was examined by the working group, together with the ethical issues and
regulatory policies in major scientific jurisdictions. A public consultation
was conducted by the BAC from 8 January 2008 to 10 March 2008 to ascertain
and understand the concerns of the Singaporean public. To facilitate public
deliberation and discussion, a consultation paper was sent to 71 research,
governmental and healthcare institutions, and professional and religious
organisations for comment. In addition, members of the public were encouraged
to share their views through various means including email, and an online
discussion forum and e-consultation managed by REACH. Two public fora were
held on 19 January 2008 and 16 August 2008. Separate meetings have also
been held with representatives of regulatory bodies, members of institutional
review boards, leaders of religious groups and stem cell researchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After extensive consultation, deliberation and discussion, the BAC concludes
that research involving human-animal combinations should be allowed on
grounds of scientific merit, provided that a regulatory framework is in
place, and ethical requirements or limits are properly observed. Five recommendations
that are consistent with current international practices and guidelines
are proposed in this Report to ensure that there is adequate and proper
oversight, and to allay public concerns. The Report further considers the
ethical, legal and social issues arising from the use of human-animal combinations
in stem cell research, and reviews best practices that have been adopted
in major scientific jurisdictions. It also attempts to dispel some misconceptions
and addresses concerns about the research as revealed in the consultations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Lim Pin, Chairman of the BAC, says: “Many people are concerned
with the possibility of developing actual independent living creatures
with both human and animal features, or animals with human consciousness
or mental characteristics. Such a creature will not arise from research
involving cytoplasmic hybrids as researchers should not be allowed to develop
such hybrids beyond 14 days or the emergence of the primitive streak, whichever
is earlier. As for chimeras created with human embryonic stem cells or
any kind of pluripotent stem cells, they should not be allowed to breed.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Senior District Judge (ret.) Mr Richard Magnus, Chairman of the Human
Embryo and Chimera Working Group, adds: “Ethics review will ensure that
research involving human-animal combinations is permitted only where there
is strong scientific merit, potential medical benefit and in the absence
of a satisfactory alternative way of pursuing the same research. In addition,
those who have a conscientious objection to such research should not be
under a duty to conduct or assist in the research.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, the Ministry of Health regulates certain types of research
in Singapore, such as clinical research and research using human embryos.
However, with research increasingly being done by research institutions
that do not fall directly under the supervision of the Ministry, the BAC
proposes that all human stem cell research, including research with human-animal
combinations, be the responsibility of a national stem cell ethics review
body. This body, which should include lay members of the public, could
appropriately be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>List of Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>
</p>
<p>A single national body, which must include lay members of the public,
should be established to review and monitor all stem cell research involving
human pluripotent stem cells or human-animal combinations conducted in
Singapore. This body should also be empowered to determine the kinds of
research that need not undergo its review.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>
</p>
<p>The creation of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos should be permitted only where
there is strong scientific merit in, and potential medical benefit from,
such research. These embryos should not be allowed to develop beyond 14
days or the appearance of the primitive streak, whichever is earlier, nor
be implanted into any human or animal uterus.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>
</p>
<p>Where human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, or any
other kind of pluripotent stem cells are introduced into non-human animals
at any stage of development, particular attention should be paid to the
need to avoid the creation of entities in which human sentience or consciousness
might be expected to occur.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong>
</p>
<p>Animals into which human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem
cells, or any other kind of pluripotent stem cells have been introduced
should not be allowed to breed.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong>
</p>
<p>No clinical or research personnel should be under a duty to conduct or
assist in stem cell research involving human-animal combinations, to which
they have a conscientious objection.</p>

<h3><strong>About the BAC</strong></h3>
<p>The BAC was established by the Government in December 2000 to address
the ethical, legal and social issues arising from human biomedical research
and its applications. It develops and recommends policies on these issues,
with the aim of protecting the rights and welfare of individuals, while
allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realise its full potential
for the benefit of mankind.</p>
