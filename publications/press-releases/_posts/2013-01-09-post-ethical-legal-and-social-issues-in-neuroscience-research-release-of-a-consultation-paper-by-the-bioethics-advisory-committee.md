<p><strong>ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IN NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) announces the release of a Consultation
Paper entitled "Ethical, Legal and Social Issues in Neuroscience Research".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapid advances in neuroscience research – the study of the brain and the
rest of the nervous system, and increasing global and local interest in
the field, led the BAC to deliberate on the implications of such research.
With an increase in the global burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders,
neuroscience research has become a priority research area in many countries,
as the search for effective therapies for these disorders becomes one of
the greatest challenges of the twenty-first century.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the brain is the seat of one’s mind, intelligence, consciousness, thoughts
and emotions, research on the human brain could be seen as different from
research on any other organs or tissues. The availability of new and more
powerful tools has made it possible not only to explore the brain in greater
detail, but also to modify it, thus giving rise to questions about the
real and potential impact of neuroscience research on the individual and
society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BAC is focusing on research that involves any intervention on the
brain, or which affects the brain or mind significantly. The Consultation
Paper highlights the main ethical, legal and social issues related to such
research, and covers the following areas:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Neuroimaging;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brain stimulation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brain-computer interfaces;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stem cell therapy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neuropharmaceuticals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Some of the concerns in neuroscience research relate to research in general,
such as obtaining informed consent of individuals with cognitive impairment
to participate in research. Obtaining informed consent could be a major
challenge in neuroscience research, because research participants may be
patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders, some of whom are particularly
vulnerable, and protecting them requires special consideration. If the
patients are either cognitively or emotionally impaired, they may not fully
understand what they are consenting to, or they may be particularly susceptible
to inducement or coercion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, unique issues are also raised by neuroscience research, particular
when involving neurotechnologies, because the human brain underlies thought,
emotion and behaviour. For example, some interventions developed to treat
neuropsychiatric disorders can enhance cognition in healthy individuals.
Others are being developed outside the purview of medicine, such as for
the detection of deception. The long-term effects of using these neurotechnologies
are not well known, and there is a possibility that it may alter one’s
personality or sense of identity. Should healthy individuals be included
in research involving the use of neurotechnologies for non-medical purposes,
particularly cognitive enhancement? As children’s brains are still developing,
should they be included in research involving the use of neurotechnologies?
Should there be any special safeguards in the ethics governance of neuroscience
research, in addition to what is already in place for other types of human
biomedical research? These are some of the issues which the BAC would like
to seek public views on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Consultation Paper will be distributed to various research, government
and healthcare institutions, and professional and religious organisations
for their comments. The BAC also invites and welcomes feedback from the
public on the issues discussed in the paper. The views of the public and
interested parties will assist the BAC in making recommendations on neuroscience
research. Those interested in providing their views could obtain a copy
of the Consultation Paper from the BAC website: <a href="www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg</a> and
send their responses by 31 March 2013 to the BAC Secretariat to: or 11
Biopolis Way, #10-12, Helios, Singapore 138667</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BAC has invited Professor Steven Hyman, one of the members of its
International Panel of Experts, to be involved in this public consultation.
Professor Hyman is the Director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research
at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and Distinguished Service Professor
of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology at Harvard University, USA. He will
be speaking at the following events:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Public forum on 12 January, 2013 (Saturday) on "Brain, Mind &amp;Technologies
- What's New &amp; What's Next?", from 2.00pm to 5.00pm, at the Science
Centre Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SAL-BAC Symposium on 11 January 2013 (Friday) from 4.00pm to 6.00pm at
the Viewing Gallery, Supreme Court; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Challenges in Neuroscience Research" – a lecture and dialogue session
(for those involved in neuroscience research or the review of such research)

<h3><strong>About the BAC</strong></h3>
<p>The BAC was established by the Government in December 2000 to address
the ethical, legal and social issues arising from human biomedical research
and its applications. It develops and recommends policies on these issues,
with the aim of protecting the rights and welfare of individuals, while
allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realise its full potential
for the benefit of mankind.</p>
