1. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC), appointed by the Cabinet in December 2000 to develop Singapore's bioethics framework for biomedical research, launched its website today. The [website](www.bioethics-singapore.org) aims to provide the public with information on the key biomedical research areas such as stem cells and cloning, and their related ethical, legal and social issues.

2. The website offers the following key features:
    - Updates on important international bioethics news and developments
    - Resources such as Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQs) to address common questions in research areas like stem cells and cloning and links to other useful sites on bioethics.

3. In line with Singapore's foray into the Biomedical Sciences, the BAC website provides an important avenue for the public to access current information about biomedical research activities and their ethical, legal and social implications. The BAC also invites the public to give their feedback or views on bioethics concerns through the website. In due course, other forms of public material such as booklets will be made available.

4. The BAC is chaired by Prof Lim Pin, University Professor at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Faculty of Medicine. The role of the BAC is to address the potential ethical, legal and social issues arising from research in the biomedical sciences in Singapore. The BAC's guiding principle is to protect the rights and welfare of individuals while allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realize its full potential in Singapore and for the benefit of mankind.
