<p>This Report of the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) sets out ethical
considerations for the conduct of genetic testing and human genetic research.</p>
<p>The recommendations in the Report build on the existing ethical guidelines
of the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health and
apply to genetic testing whether conducted in a clinical or research setting.
However, the recommendations on consent and counselling do not apply to
standard clinical tests for the purposes of diagnosis or treatment, unless
the tests involve direct analysis of human DNA, RNA, genes and/or chromosomes.</p>
<p>Ethical considerations provided by the BAC include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Genetic testing should be voluntary and conducted only after informed
consent has been obtained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Careful and responsible use of genetic testing on vulnerable persons such
as children and adolescents, the mentally impaired and persons in dependent
relationships; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safeguarding the privacy of tested individuals and ensuring the confidentiality
of genetic information, unless the life of a third party is endangered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The BAC recommends that the non-consensual or deceitful taking of human
tissues for the purpose of genetic testing should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Specific ethical considerations have been set out by the BAC in relation
to five types of genetic testing. The BAC recommends against the clinical
practice of germline genetic modification at this time.</p>
<p>In view of the religious and ethical concerns with preimplantation genetic
testing, the BAC also recommends that a provision be made so that no one
shall be under any duty to be involved in such testing on the basis that
he or she has a conscientious objection.</p>
<p>This Report is the culmination of an extensive research, which began in
October 2003, and a public consultation process. To facilitate discussion
and the gathering of feedback from the general public, the BAC held dialogue
sessions with religious representatives and healthcare professionals, and
further organised 14 focus group discussions (from 14 May to 9 July 2005).
This Report follows upon earlier Reports of the BAC on Human Stem Cell
Research and Cloning (June 2002), Human Tissue Research (November 2002)
and Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidelines for IRBs (November 2004).</p>
<p>Singapore’s Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) announces the publication
of its recommendations for genetic testing and research. In its report
entitled “Genetic Testing and Genetic Research”, the BAC sets out considerations
for the ethical use of genetic testing in the detection of specific heritable
genetic conditions and susceptibilities, as well as the genetic information
thereby derived. In addition, the BAC also provides ethical guidance on
the conduct of human genetic research in general.</p>
<p>Professor Lim Pin, Chairman of the BAC, says: “Scientific advances in
human genetics have greatly increased our understanding of genes and their
impact on health and diseases. In recent years, a wide range of genetic
tests has become available clinically and there is active research into
developing novel tests for various diseases in many countries. However,
the predictive nature of genetic information derived from genetic testing
is sensitive not only for its impact on the tested individual, but also
for those who are genetically related to this person. It is therefore important
for testing to be conducted responsibly and ethically.”</p>
<p>The recommendations of the BAC relate to the ethical conduct of clinical
genetic testing, as well as genetic testing for research. In the ethical
conduct of clinical genetic testing, the BAC further considers issues in
connection with the quality of clinical genetic tests and the interpretation
of test results. These recommendations build on some of the ethical guidelines
that have been issued by the National Medical Ethics Committee (NMEC) in
its Ethical Guidelines for Gene Technology published in February 2001.
The BAC has placed particular emphasis on the importance of sound and effective
counselling in the conduct of genetic testing in a clinical context. However,
the BAC has made clear that its recommendations do not supersede established
medical guidelines concerning standard clinical tests conducted for the
purposes of diagnosis or treatment. For such tests, the BAC’s recommendations
relating to consent and counselling do not apply, unless analysis of human
DNA, RNA, genes and/or chromosomes is involved.</p>
<p>In recognition of the predictive power of genetic information that is
derived from genetic testing, the ethical considerations noted by the BAC
include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Genetic testing should be voluntary and conducted only after informed
consent has been obtained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Careful and responsible use of genetic testing on vulnerable persons such
as children and adolescents, the mentally impaired and persons in dependent
relationships; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safeguarding the privacy of tested individuals and ensuring the confidentiality
of genetic information, unless the life of a third party is endangered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to conduct genetic testing on tissue samples (such as a
piece of hair) obtained through deception or taken without the consent
of an individual. The resulting information could be used in ways that
are not in the interests of the individual. Associate Professor Terry Kaan,
Chairman of the BAC’s Human Genetics Subcommittee, which led the work on
this Report, says that: “One emerging area of concern is the increasing
availability of genetic testing kits and services across borders, and especially
over the internet. Many issues are raised by this new kind of market. For
example, there is now concern that the ready availability of such services
over the internet may be abused for the purposes of unwanted intrusion
into someone's privacy by obtaining genetic information without that person's
consent. Theoretically, for some tests, all you may need nowadays is a
mouth swab, or a discarded toothbrush. So we have recommended that non-consensual
or deceitful taking of human tissues for the purposes of genetic testing
should be prohibited.” The BAC further recommends that genetic testing
should generally be conducted by a qualified healthcare professional, and
the availability of tests that provide predictive health information directly
to the public should be limited.</p>
<p>Specific ethical considerations are set out in the Report for the responsible
conduct of carrier testing, preimplantation genetic testing, prenatal genetic
diagnosis, predictive testing and genetic screening. Generally, laboratories
conducting these and other clinical genetic testing should be accredited.
Test results should then be interpreted by an appropriately qualified or
sufficiently experienced healthcare professional. As far as is practicable,
genetic counselling should immediately follow, particularly if the test
result is not favourable.</p>
<p>Owing to the religious and ethical concerns with preimplantation genetic
testing, the BAC recommends that such testing should only be conducted
pursuant to licensing and monitoring by a relevant authority and should
further be limited to serious genetic conditions. In addition, the BAC
proposes for a provision to be made so that no one will be under any duty
to be involved in preimplantation genetic testing if he or she has a conscientious
objection.</p>
<p>In recent years, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used in combination
with tissue typing. Such a technique, known as preimplantation tissue typing,
not only allows couples to have a healthy child, but also enables the selection
of an immunogenetically compatible stem cell donor to save a sick sibling.
The BAC considers the use of preimplantation tissue typing to be permissible
provided that it is subject to licensing control by a relevant authority
and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>In view of the possible use of preimplantation genetic testing and prenatal
genetic diagnosis for the selection of traits or gender for non-medical
reasons, the BAC recommends that such use be disallowed.</p>
<p>Recent advancement in gene technology allows an individual’s genetic makeup
to be altered in a manner that is permanent and can be transmitted to his
or her offspring. Such technology – known as germline genetic modification
– is still experimental and presents serious ethical concerns. For these
reasons, the BAC recommends against the clinical practice of germline genetic
modification, although progress in this technology will be monitored and
its clinical applicability reassessed at an appropriate time in the future.</p>
<p>The Report is the culmination of extensive research into the policies
and guidelines of various international and national ethics, governmental
and professional bodies, which commenced approximately two years ago. On
5 April 2005, a consultation paper was distributed to 107 healthcare and
governmental institutions (including the NMEC) and professional, religious
and patient support organisations for comments. A total of 31 written responses
were received. In addition, the BAC held dialogue sessions with religious
representatives and healthcare professionals, and further organised 14
focus group discussions (from 14 May to 9 July 2005) to facilitate discussion
and gathering of feedback from the general public. The written responses
and reports on the dialogue sessions and focus group discussions have been
published as annexes to the Report. All views provided to the BAC had been
carefully considered in formulating the recommendations, including feedback
from the BAC’s International Panel of Experts and the International Advisory
Council of the Biomedical Sciences Initiative.</p>
<p>These recommendations have been presented to and accepted by the Life
Sciences Steering Committee (previously, Life Sciences Ministerial Committee).

<p><strong>LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Information</strong>
</p>
<p>Genetic information derived from clinical genetic testing should be regarded
as medical information and the usual standards in medical ethics apply
in its derivation, management and use.</p>
<p><strong>General Ethical Considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>Genetic testing should be conducted in a manner that is respectful of
the welfare, safety, religious and cultural perspectives and traditions
of individuals.</p>
<p>Genetic testing should be voluntary. The individual should be given sufficient
time and information to ensure informed consent before testing. Consent
should also be obtained for the future use of tissue specimens.</p>
<p>The non-consensual or deceitful taking of human tissues for the purpose
of genetic testing should be prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Testing of Vulnerable Persons</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not recommend the broad use of genetic testing on children and adolescents.
Confirmatory testing and predictive testing for genetic conditions where
preventive intervention or treatment is available and beneficial in childhood
are recommended. Carrier testing should generally be deferred until the
child is mature or when required to make reproductive decisions, but where
compelling interests of other family members or public health interests
exist, the physician should be able to decide, together with the parents,
whether or not to determine the carrier status of the child. Predictive
testing where there is no preventive intervention or treatment, or where
intervention or treatment is only available and beneficial during adulthood,
should be discouraged.</p>
<p>Clinical genetic testing involving vulnerable persons should only be conducted
if it is medically beneficial to the vulnerable persons and after informed
consent has been obtained. In the case of persons in dependent relationships,
extra care should be taken to ensure that such persons clearly understand
that refusal to consent will not prejudice any current or prospective benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality and Privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>Results from clinical genetic testing should only be used to advantage
or empower an individual or family and for the management or prevention
of disease. Such information should not be disclosed to third parties without
the informed consent of the individual unless in exceptional circumstances
when the information is required to avert serious harm.</p>
<p>An individual should be informed of the result of a clinical genetic test
without undue delay unless he or she has clearly indicated a wish not to
know.</p>
<p><strong>Preimplantation Genetic Testing</strong>
</p>
<p>Preimplantation genetic screening and diagnosis are permissible, subject
to licensing and monitoring by a relevant authority and should be limited
to preventing serious genetic conditions. Provision should also be made
so that no one shall be under any duty to be involved in preimplantation
genetic testing to which he or she has a conscientious objection.</p>
<p>The use of preimplantation genetic testing for the selection of desired
traits or gender for non-medical reasons should not be allowed.</p>
<p>Preimplantation tissue typing, whether as the sole objective or in conjunction
with preimplantation genetic diagnosis to avoid a serious genetic disorder,
is permissible but should be licensed and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Germline Genetic Modification</strong>
</p>
<p>The clinical practice of germline genetic modification should not be allowed
at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Prenatal Genetic Diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>Prenatal genetic diagnosis should be limited to serious medical disorders.
The use of prenatal genetic diagnosis for the selection of desired traits
or gender for non-medical reasons should not be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Predictive Testing</strong>
</p>
<p>Presymptomatic testing should be available for adults at risk who request
it, even in the absence of treatment, after proper counselling and informed
consent.</p>
<p>Susceptibility testing should not be applied clinically unless there is
significant empirical evidence of validity and utility.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Screening</strong>
</p>
<p>In genetic screening programmes, a confirmatory diagnostic test should
be performed as soon as possible after a positive screening test, so as
to minimise unnecessary anxiety or to enable measures for the prevention
or treatment of the condition to be instituted without delay.</p>
<p><strong>Standards of Genetic Test Providers</strong>
</p>
<p>All laboratories conducting clinical genetic tests should be accredited
by a body designated by the relevant authority, based on standards it considers
appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Results Interpretation</strong>
</p>
<p>Interpretation of clinical genetic test results should only be performed
by healthcare professionals who are appropriately qualified or have sufficient
experience. As far as is practicable, genetic counselling should immediately
follow the disclosure of the test result, particularly if the test result
is not favourable.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Counselling</strong>
</p>
<p>Genetic counselling should be offered to all individuals before and after
they undergo clinical genetic testing.</p>
<p>Genetic counselling should generally be conducted in a non-directive manner
and should provide sufficient information and appropriate support to the
individual and his or her family members.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Diversification and Development</strong>
</p>
<p>The relevant authority should provide professional training and accreditation
in medical genetics and counselling to healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Supply of Genetic Tests to the Public</strong>
</p>
<p>Genetic testing should generally be conducted through a qualified healthcare
professional. Tests that provide predictive health information should not
be offered directly to the public. The advertising of direct genetic tests
to the public should be strongly discouraged. The relevant authority should
develop an oversight framework for the supply of genetic tests, services
and information direct to the public.</p>
