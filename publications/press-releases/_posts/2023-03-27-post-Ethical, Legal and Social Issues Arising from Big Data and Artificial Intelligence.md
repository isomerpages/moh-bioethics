**Ethical, Legal and Social Issues Arising from Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Human Biomedical Research**

1\. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) has issued a public consultation paper on the ethical, legal and social issues arising from Big Data and AI use in human biomedical research, and invites public feedback on the potential issues related to the use of big data and AI applications in biomedical research. 

2\. The views of the public and interested organisations will assist the BAC in formulating its recommendations for its advisory report which will guide academics, researchers, healthcare professionals, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in the ethical use of big data and AI applications in biomedical research. It will also provide ethical guidance to policy and decision-makers, as well as support the safe growth of AI in biomedical and healthcare research.  

3\. The report complements other big data and AI reports and ethical guidelines such as the ‘Ethics Framework for Big Data in Health and Research’ by the Science, Health, and Policy-relevant Ethics in Singapore (SHAPES) working group and the AI in Healthcare Guidelines (AIHGle) co-developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS).

4\. The public consultation will last for about 9 weeks from 26 April 2023 to 27 June 2023.

**Big Data and AI – Recent Developments**

5\.  The use of big data and AI technologies has enabled researchers to extract features and valuable insights from large datasets. With the continual development of new algorithms to improve accuracy in pattern recognition such as diagnosis and prediction of disease outcomes, big data and AI will play increasingly larger roles in the future of biomedical research, clinical research and healthcare.

6\. A common application (and a subset) of AI is machine learning where algorithms are trained to identify and resolve patterns like the human brain. A recent development of deep neural networks (a subset of machine learning) further imitates the human brain's ability to identify images, objects, improve drug discovery, upgrade precision medicines, improve diagnosis and assist humans to make decisions.  

7\. The most significant source of big data use in biomedical research in this decade would be electronic health-related data collected via health platforms such as electronic health records, personal health monitoring technologies, home sensors, social media applications, healthcare related forums, patient portals, biomedical search queries on search engines and generic databases.

**Issues and Questions for Consideration**

8\. The BAC would like to invite the public to contribute their views and feedback on a range of ethical, social and legal issues that could arise from the use of big data and AI applications in biomedical research.

**a. Responsible Data Usage**

Responsible data usage ensures that data is used in a fair and transparent manner without compromising data integrity and seeks to protect individual privacy and control of personal data. It is also key to preventing risk of discrimination or injustice, or inaccurate research outcomes stemming from bias in AI algorithms and the data used to train the algorithms.

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	How should human biomedical research data be managed and used responsibly to avoid the risk of discrimination arising from participation or biases in biomedical research? 

ii. 	How should researchers or developers ensure that data fed into the algorithm is not biased or result in bias-driven outcomes when developing AI algorithms? 

iii. What is the ethical significance of ‘social licence’ in ensuring responsible big data and AI use in biomedical research? 


**b. Data Ownership, Custodianship, and Stewardship**

With increasing use of big data and AI in biomedical research, data owners need to ensure that the data is secured and appropriately accessed whereas data custodians ensure that mechanisms are in place to ensure the responsible and ethical use of data to protect the privacy of individual data, and data security. Data stewardship complements data custodianship by ensuring the safe management of the data resource as a whole and training and educating stakeholders about the importance of responsible data management. 

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	Should a person who had provided biological materials or data but did not participate in the subsequent processing or analysis have intellectual property rights in the data?

ii.	How should large volumes of biomedical data shared across countries in international research collaborations be managed?

 **c.	Data Privacy, Accessibility and Security**
 
Data privacy, accessibility and security would be necessary to ensure that individuals’ personal data rights and interests are protected through robust technical security systems while facilitating access to the protected data by legitimate third parties.  

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	How can providers/researchers ensure robust data security and proper access control while maintaining data privacy? 

ii.	How can institutions or organisations managing data stored in multiple on-site servers or cloud repositories ensure appropriate data accessibility?

**d.	Data Anonymisation, De- and Re-identification of Data**

Anonymisation, de- and re-identification of data are tools used in biomedical research to enable data to be analysed while protecting the data contributors’ privacy. As analyses involving big data and AI algorithms in biomedical research rely increasingly on large volumes of personal, health and medical data, conventional methods of de-identification and anonymisation may no longer be adequate in protecting privacy. 

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	Are the current methods of anonymisation and de-identification still applicable when large volumes of personal, health and medical data are used in big data and AI research?

ii.	Should genetic data should be treated differently from other types of personal and health data?

**e. Revising Consent in the Arena of Big Data and AI**

Consent could be classified as broad, specific, implied, explicit and dynamic. Issues pertaining to consent in the use of big data and AI in biomedical research include differences in consent taking for health and medical data collected via traditional versus non-traditional data collection methods, and differences between consent for usage of data from cohort studies and that from real-world data. 

**f.	Responsibility to the Public in Data-Sharing for Research**

Responsible data sharing can lead to research that benefits individuals, communities, and society. The challenge is in ensuring that data sharing for research is conducted ethically, equitably, and with proper respect for privacy. One important consideration is how benefits of biomedical research can be shared with participants whose data is used. 

**g.	Ethical Considerations and Issues Specific to AI**

Ethical principles that may apply to AI in biomedical research include transparency, explainability, and justifiability. Other key considerations include reliability and safety, accountability, human agency, equitable access and model security to minimise potential harm to individuals and parties involved in research projects. 


Ethical issues include the ethical responsibility of biomedical researchers and AI developers to comply with best standards to ensure clinical safety of AI modes, enabling equitable access to AI technologies in research and how to ensure ‘AI model security’ to prevent attacks on AI models and protect data confidentiality.

ANNEX

**About the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC)**
<br>The BAC is an independent advisory committee that was established by the Government in December 2000 to address the ethical, legal and social issues arising from human biomedical research and its applications. BAC studies emerging areas in human biomedical research, and develops and recommends policies to the government as appropriate, with the aim of protecting the rights and welfare of individuals, while allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realise its full potential for the benefit of mankind.
