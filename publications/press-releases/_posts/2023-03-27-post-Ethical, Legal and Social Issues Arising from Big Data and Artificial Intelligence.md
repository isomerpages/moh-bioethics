**PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES ARISING FROM BIG DATA AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USE IN HUMAN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH**

1\. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) has developed a public consultation paper on the ethical, legal and social issues arising from ‘Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Human Biomedical Research’ and invites public feedback from 26 April 2023 to 27 June 2023.  

**Ethical Challenges of Big Data and AI Use in Human Biomedical Research**

2\. With advances in information technology, data and computational analytics in recent decades, the use of big data<sup>[1]</sup>  and AI <sup>[2]</sup>  in human biomedical research has become increasingly important and enabled researchers and healthcare professionals to analyse massive datasets, generate useful insights, and enhance data-driven decisions. Some of the healthcare applications include monitoring of diseases and outbreaks, predicting of health behaviours and disease outcomes, providing risk stratification for individual patients, and facilitating patient care management.  

3\. While the growing use of big data and AI in biomedical research promises numerous benefits, it also gives rise to emerging ethical issues such as the need for protecting data privacy versus ensuring societal benefit; importance of obtaining informed consent and respecting individual’s rights and autonomy; and extent of data security obligation with respect to value of data, which warrant further deliberation and review. 

**Aim of Consultation**

4\. Recognising the emerging ethical challenges, the BAC has developed a public consultation paper to discuss the ethical principles to guide such use, namely, respect for persons, solidarity, justice, proportionality, sustainability, and other ethical considerations including integrity, transparency, accountability, consistency and stakeholder engagement. The views of the public, stakeholders, research institutions, and interested organisations will assist the BAC in developing recommendations to guide academics, healthcare professionals, researchers, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) on the ethical principles of big data and AI use in biomedical research. 

5\. The report builds upon previous BAC reports and recommendations and references relevant legislations such as the Personal Data Protection Act (2012) and the Human Biomedical Research Act (2015) and is intended to complement other big data and AI reports and ethical guidelines in Singapore to provide ethical guidance to decision-makers who work with big data in health and research, and improve the understanding, codify good practice and support the safe growth of AI in biomedical and healthcare research. 

**Scope of Consultation** 

6\. The scope of the public consultation paper will cover ethical issues arising from the use of big data and AI in human biomedical research, such as responsible data usage, data ownership, custodianship, and stewardship, data privacy, accessibility and security, data anonymisation and other ethical considerations and issues specific to AI. 

7\. The BAC would like to invite the public to provide feedback on the following ethical issues and questions:

**a. Responsible Data Usage**

Responsible data usage ensures that data is used in a fair and transparent manner without compromising data integrity and seeks to protect individual privacy and control of personal data. It is also key to preventing risk of discrimination or injustice, or inaccurate research outcomes stemming from bias in AI algorithms and the data used to train the algorithms.

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	How should human biomedical research data be managed and used responsibly to avoid the risk of discrimination arising from participation or biases in biomedical research? 

ii. 	How should researchers or developers ensure that data fed into the algorithm is not biased or result in bias-driven outcomes when developing AI algorithms? 

iii. What is the ethical significance of ‘social licence’ in ensuring responsible big data and AI use in biomedical research? 


**b. Data Ownership, Custodianship, and Stewardship**

With increasing use of big data and AI in biomedical research, data owners need to ensure that the data is secured and appropriately accessed whereas data custodians ensure that mechanisms are in place to ensure the responsible and ethical use of data to protect the privacy of individual data, and data security. Data stewardship complements data custodianship by ensuring the safe management of the data resource as a whole and training and educating stakeholders about the importance of responsible data management. 

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	Should a person who had provided biological materials or data but did not participate in the subsequent processing or analysis have intellectual property rights in the data?

ii.	How should large volumes of biomedical data shared across countries in international research collaborations be managed?

 **c.	Data Privacy, Accessibility and Security**
 
Data privacy, accessibility and security would be necessary to ensure that individuals’ personal data rights and interests are protected through robust technical security systems while facilitating access to the protected data by legitimate third parties.  

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	How can providers/researchers ensure robust data security and proper access control while maintaining data privacy? 

ii.	How can institutions or organisations managing data stored in multiple on-site servers or cloud repositories ensure appropriate data accessibility?

**d.	Data Anonymisation, De- and Re-identification of Data**

Anonymisation, de- and re-identification of data are tools used in biomedical research to enable data to be analysed while protecting the data contributors’ privacy. As analyses involving big data and AI algorithms in biomedical research rely increasingly on large volumes of personal, health and medical data, conventional methods of de-identification and anonymisation may no longer be adequate in protecting privacy. 

**Ethical Considerations:**

i.	Are the current methods of anonymisation and de-identification still applicable when large volumes of personal, health and medical data are used in big data and AI research?

ii.	Should genetic data should be treated differently from other types of personal and health data?

**e. Revising Consent in the Arena of Big Data and AI**

Consent could be classified as broad, specific, implied, explicit and dynamic. Issues pertaining to consent in the use of big data and AI in biomedical research include differences in consent taking for health and medical data collected via traditional versus non-traditional data collection methods, and differences between consent for usage of data from cohort studies and that from real-world data. 

**Ethical Considerations:**

**f.	Responsibility to the Public in Data-Sharing for Research**

Responsible data sharing can lead to research that benefits individuals, communities, and society. The challenge is in ensuring that data sharing for research is conducted ethically, equitably, and with proper respect for privacy. One important consideration is how benefits of biomedical research can be shared with participants whose data is used. 

**Ethical Considerations:**

**g.	Ethical Considerations and Issues Specific to AI**

Ethical principles that may apply to AI in biomedical research include transparency, explainability, and justifiability. Other key considerations include reliability and safety, accountability, human agency, equitable access and model security to minimise potential harm to individuals and parties involved in research projects. 


Ethical issues include the ethical responsibility of biomedical researchers and AI developers to comply with best standards to ensure clinical safety of AI modes, enabling equitable access to AI technologies in research and how to ensure ‘AI model security’ to prevent attacks on AI models and protect data confidentiality.

**Ethical Considerations:**

**Period of Consultation**

8\. The public consultation will last for a period of nine weeks from 26 April 2023 to 27 June 2023. All comments should be sent by 27 June 2023. Any comments received after 27 June 2023 will not be considered.
