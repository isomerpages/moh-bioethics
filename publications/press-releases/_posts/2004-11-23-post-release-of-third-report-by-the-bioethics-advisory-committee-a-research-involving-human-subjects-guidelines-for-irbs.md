<p>This Report of the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) sets out guidelines
for ethics governance of research involving human subjects.</p>
<p>The guidelines require all human biomedical research in Singapore, including
research involving human tissue or medical information, to be subject to
ethics governance.</p>
<p>Ethics governance is to be carried out by institutional review boards
of all institutions involved in human biomedical research.</p>
<p>The guidelines set out:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the constitution, accreditation and operation of institutional review
boards; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the roles and responsibilities of institutions, institutional review boards
and researchers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The guidelines are built on current system of regulations for pharmaceutical
trials and for human biomedical research conducted by hospitals, private
clinics and other healthcare establishments under the supervision of the
Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>BAC regards high standards of ethical governance for the protection of
life, health, privacy and dignity of human subjects in biomedical research
as vital to the progress of biomedical sciences in Singapore and to the
reputation of Singapore as a global centre of excellence in biomedical
research.</p>
<p>This Report is the culmination of an extensive research and consultation
process, which began in April 2003 and follows upon earlier Reports of
the BAC on Human Stem Cell Research and Cloning (June 2002) and on Human
Tissue Research (November 2002).</p>
<p>Singapore’s Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) today announced the publication
of its report on the ethics governance of research involving human subjects.
Entitled "Research involving Human Subjects: Guidelines for IRBs", the
Report seeks to clarify the roles and responsibilities of institutional
review boards (IRBs), institutions and researchers in fostering a culture
of good practice, transparency and accountability in the conduct of human
biomedical research in Singapore. The guidelines set out in the Report
encapsulate universally accepted principles on ethics governance for the
protection of the life, health, privacy and dignity of human subjects in
biomedical research.</p>
<p>Professor Lim Pin, Chairman of the BAC, says: “It is important for Singapore
to establish clear and transparent standards and procedures for human biomedical
research so that Singapore’s reputation as a global centre of excellence
in biomedical research can be upheld and strengthened.”</p>
<p>The recommendations set out in the Report require all institutions (whether
private or public) conducting human biomedical research in Singapore, including
research involving human tissue or medical information, to establish IRBs
to review and supervise such research. Where it is impracticable to set
up an IRB (in the case of an individual researcher or a small group of
researchers for instance), appropriate arrangements should be made with
a hosting institution so that the research may be subject to ethics governance
by an IRB. An IRB should be organised at, and integral to, the function
of the highest administrative level of an institution. Associate Professor
Terry Kaan, Chairman of BAC's Human Genetics Subcommittee, which led the
work on this Report, says that: "We think it is important that IRBs should
be staffed by an institution's most senior and most respected officers,
researchers or consultants. The participation of an institution's top medical,
scientific and administrative leadership would ensure that ethics governance
is carried out by the best people with the appropriate knowledge, experience
and training for the task. They would also set the tone in ensuring that
the ethics governance process is independent, impartial and fair."</p>
<p>Under the current system, only pharmaceutical trials involving the testing
of drugs on human subjects and human biomedical research conducted by hospitals,
private clinics and healthcare establishments falling within the purview
of the Ministry of Health (MOH), are required to undergo ethics review.
The guidelines in this Report which are built on the basic framework of
ethics governance issued by the NMEC (National Medical Ethics Committee)
in 1997, expand the scope of ethics governance to include all human biomedical
research conducted in Singapore, whether or not they are carried out in
institutions under the purview of the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>The new framework of ethics governance requires all biomedical research
involving human subjects to undergo a formal process of ethics review.
Such review may vary from a full formal process to an expedited process,
depending on the potential and actual risks that the research under review
poses to the human subjects. However, ethics review may be exempted in
certain special cases which carry no risk to human subjects or in exceptional
situations of national security or emergency health situations.</p>
<p>The Report also sets out the roles and responsibilities of institutions,
IRBs and researchers (below). The fundamental responsibility of an IRB
is to act as an ethics review gateway for all human biomedical research,
with the primary objectives of the protection and assurance of the safety,
health, dignity, welfare and well-being of human research subjects. Researchers
share with IRBs and institutions a primary role in the ethics governance
of human biomedical research but the ultimate responsibility for the ethical
compliance of all aspects of the research rests with the researcher. Institutions
have the overall responsibility of ensuring the proper conduct of human
biomedical research carried out by their employees on their premises.</p>
<p>In addition, the guidelines assist IRBs, institutions and researchers
in the discharge of their respective responsibilities by addressing a variety
of practical matters. They include conflicts of interest, multinational
and multi-centre research projects, specific operating procedures such
as those relating to fair review and documentation of decisions, deviations
from and variations to research protocols that have been reviewed, the
relationship between researchers and attending physicians of subject-patients,
and the workload and protection of IRBs.</p>
<p>However, the guidelines do not apply to any human biomedical research
in relation to genetically modified organisms, animals and their treatment,
and economic, sociological and other studies in the disciplines of the
humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>The Report is the culmination of an extensive research process, which
began in April 2003. On 16 September 2003, a consultation paper was distributed
to 37 bodies concerned with the ethics governance of human biomedical research
in Singapore. In addition, a dialogue session with the hospital ethics
committees and IRBs was held on 7 November 2003. The consultation paper,
the responses received in relation to the consultation paper and a summary
of the dialogue session are included as annexes to the Report. The recommendations
in the Report incorporate feedback received, including feedback from the
BAC's International Panel of Experts and the International Advisory Council
of the Biomedical Sciences Initiative.</p>
<p>These guidelines and recommendations have been presented to and accepted
by the Life Sciences Ministerial Committee.</p>
<p>A copy of the Report is available on this website.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>General</strong>
</p>
<p>All Human Biomedical Research should be reviewed and approved by a properly
constituted IRB before it is allowed to proceed. Some research, however,
could qualify for Exempted Review or Expedited Review if it involves no
risk or minimal risk to the safety, health, dignity and welfare of the
research subjects and provided that the protection of the subjects’ privacy
is strictly observed.</p>
<p>It is recommended that all IRBs be formally accredited by the MOH.</p>
<p>These Guidelines apply to all Human Biomedical Research wherever such
research may be carried out in Singapore, whether or not such research
is carried out in an institution under the direct jurisdiction of the MOH
pursuant to the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act.</p>
<p><strong>IRBs</strong>
</p>
<p>IRBs are accountable to their appointing institutions and they are responsible
for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The ethics review and approval of proposed Human Biomedical Research programmes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The continuing review and supervision of the research programmes approved
by them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting to their respective institutions any unusual or unexpected events
arising from the research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing feedback to and maintaining dialogue about applicable standards
with their constituent researchers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receiving feedback from research subjects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the ethics review process, IRBs must be aware of any actual, potential
or apparent conflict of interest and take reasonable steps to avoid or
minimise such conflicts.</p>
<p>The scientific review of research proposals does not lie with the IRB.
It is for the researchers to satisfy the IRB that an objective review of
scientific merit has been carried out and to make these findings (whether
positive or negative) available to the IRB.</p>
<p>In multi-centre research, a “lead” IRB should be designated from among
the IRBs of participating institutions. The lead IRB will play the main
role in conducting a full ethics review, in coordinating the research programme
and in keeping other participating IRBs informed of any decisions and amendments
made during the whole research period. The local portion of a multinational
research programme should be subject to review by the local IRB.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers</strong>
</p>
<p>Researchers must comply with all the conditions laid down by the IRB that
approved their project.</p>
<p>Researchers are also responsible for ensuring that their research complies
with all relevant laws and other regulatory obligations and requirements.</p>
<p>Researchers are required to inform and seek approval from their IRBs for
any proposed variations from the terms of approval of the projects before
such variations can be implemented.</p>
<p>Researchers should submit annual (or more frequent) progress reports as
required by their IRBs, as well as project completion reports and reports
of adverse events.</p>
<p>Researchers should inform and discuss with the research subjects’ attending
physicians if the research involves interfering with the subjects’ medical
management.</p>
<p><strong>Institutions</strong>
</p>
<p>Institutions have the overall responsibility of ensuring the proper conduct
of Human Biomedical Research carried out by their employees on their premises.</p>
<p>Every institution involved in Human Biomedical Research as defined in
these Guidelines should establish and maintain an effective IRB. The institution
must accept legal responsibility for the decisions of its IRB. IRBs may
be shared by more than one institution. They could also be domain specific,
providing more focused and specialised ethics review.</p>
<p>Each institution must set up clear policies for the establishment and
operation of its IRB. The institution will determine the composition and
constitution of the IRB, the specific operating procedures for ethics review
and categories of research for Exempted Review and Expedited Review.</p>
<p>Institutions are responsible for providing their IRB members with full
indemnity.</p>
<p>Institutions, in particular those with sizeable research programmes, should
have in place programmes for the training and education of their IRB members.</p>
<p>Institutions should, in consultation with their IRBs, ensure that clear
formal procedures are laid down for the release of all kinds of patients’
medical information.</p>
<p>Institutions should also ensure that there are adequate resources to enable
their IRBs to discharge their duties and responsibilities in an effective
and timely manner.</p>
