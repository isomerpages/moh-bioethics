<p><strong>PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL ISSUES IN HUMAN NUCLEAR GENOME EDITING</strong>
</p>
<p>1\. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) will conduct a public consultation
to seek views and feedback on the ethical, legal, and social issues in
Human Nuclear Genome Editing (HNGE). The online consultation will be conducted
from <strong>3 June 2024 to xx August 2024</strong> and can be accessed from
&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/files/publications/consultation-papers/big-data-and-ai.pdf/&quot;>here</a>or" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/files/publications/consultation-papers/big-data-and-ai.pdf/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;or</a>&lt;a

<p><strong>Ethical Challenges of HNGE applications in biomedical and clinical research, and healthcare</strong>
</p>
<p>2\. Applications of HNGE technologies in human biomedical research have
advanced developments in genetics, disease modelling and therapeutics.
The increasing use of non-heritable gene editing&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;
in clinical applications holds promise for treating genetic disorders,
infertility, enhancing personalised medicine and improving health outcomes.
While HNGE technologies have the potential to confer resistance to diseases
and enhance traits in the future, they also raise ethical issues such as
unintended consequences and long-term effects on individuals and future
generations, resulting in social inequalities, and other issues on consent.
Maintaining a balance between scientific innovation and ethical responsibility
remains a challenge in navigating the complex landscape of HNGE.</p>
<p><strong>Scope and Aim of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>3\. Recognising these ethical challenges, the BAC has developed a public
consultation paper titled ‘Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues arising from
Human Nuclear Genome Editing’ to discuss the ethical issues from the use
of HNGE technologies in biomedical and clinical research and other potential
clinical applications, such as mosaicism, off-target effects, long-term
safety, equitable access, the broad effect of genetic enhancement on society,
and how the HNGE governance framework can be implemented in Singapore.
The paper also discusses the ethical principles underpinning the applications
of HNGE, such as respect for persons, solidarity<sup>2</sup>, justice,
proportionality<sup>3</sup>, sustainability, and responsible stewardship
of science<sup>4</sup>. The paper is intended to guide academics, researchers,
healthcare professionals, research and healthcare institutions, Clinical
Ethics Committees (CECs) and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) on the
ethical use of HNGE applications in human biomedical research, clinical
research, and healthcare.</p>
<p>4\. The paper builds upon previous BAC reports and recommendations, referencing
relevant legislation/Acts such as the Human Biomedical Research Act (2015),
the Human Cloning and Other Prohibited Practices Act (2004), and the Healthcare
Services Act (2020).</p>
<p>5\. Through the public consultation, the BAC aims to gather inputs from
academics, researchers, research and healthcare institutions, healthcare
professionals, professional bodies and societies, CECs, IRBs, religious
organisations, industry partners, and the public on key ethical questions
and issues discussed in the consultation paper. Please refer to <strong><u>Annex A</u></strong> for
the outline of key ethical questions and issues raised in the consultation
paper.</p>
<p>6\. The views of the public, academic, research, and healthcare institutions,
CECs, IRBs, professional bodies and societies, religious organisations,
and other interested organisations will assist the BAC in developing its
recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>7\. The public consultation will last for a period of two months from <strong>3 June 2024 to xx August 2024</strong>.
All comments should be sent in by <strong>xx August <u>2024</u></strong>.

<p><strong><u>ANNEX A</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>[Invitation To Comment] Public Consultation Paper: Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues Arising from Human Nuclear Genome Editing</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>a. Mosaicism<sup>5</sup>, Off-Target Effects, and On-Target Undesirable Modifications</strong>
</p>
<p>1\. Gene editing technologies could enable corrections to the genomic
sequence to rectify or remove mutations that lead to adverse health conditions.
Such technologies could also lead to unintended biological outcomes such
as chromosomal mosaicism in embryos, and undesirable consequences (e.g.,
development of cancer and allergic reactions) arising from off-target mutations
and deletions.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. How should researchers and clinicians balance the potential benefits
of gene editing technologies against the risks associated with mosaicism
and off-target effects?</p>
<p>ii. How can researchers ensure that patients or participants undergoing
non-heritable gene editing interventions are fully informed of the risks
associated with such applications?</p>
<p>iii. Should clinical applications of heritable gene editing be allowed,
given the possibility that future generations may suffer from unintended
consequences associated with such applications?</p>
<p><strong>b. Safety and Long-Term Effects of HNGE</strong>
</p>
<p>2\. Gene editing may potentially offer new ways of treating diseases and
could be used for enhancement of human performance. Nonetheless, it has
not received general acceptance for widespread use in clinical practice
as the technology is still in its early phase of development. This raises
concerns regarding the safety and long-term side effects of the technology
on individuals receiving the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. How should researchers, research institutions and clinicians ensure
favourable risk-benefit ratio is achieved for patients or participants
undergoing clinical trials or clinical interventions involving non-heritable
gene editing?</p>
<p>ii. What can researchers do to mitigate challenges and alleviate long-term
consequences associated with non-heritable gene editing to ensure responsible
stewardship of science?</p>
<p>iii. Should clinical applications of heritable gene editing be allowed,
given the difficulty in predicting the long-term consequences of such applications
on future generations?</p>
<p>iv. What are the ethical challenges involved in conducting follow-up studies
to determine the long-term side effects of gene editing interventions in
research participants?</p>
<p>c. Procurement and Use of Human Embryos and Oocytes in HNGE Research</p>
<p>3\. Human embryos have been used by researchers on gene editing as a tool
to enhance knowledge about human gene function and early embryonic development,
as well as to advance research on infertility, genetic diseases, and intractable
diseases. While procuring oocytes with the desired genotype from healthy
individuals can enable researchers to study heterozygous gene mutations
in embryos for a given disease-causing gene, or to correct a specific gene
mutation, it may lead to health risks for donors. Another ethical issue
involved in the use of embryos for gene editing research is potential privacy
breach.</p>
<p>Ethical Considerations:</p>
<p>i. How do researchers and research institutions weigh the potential benefits
of gene editing research on human embryos and oocytes against the ethical
and safety concerns?</p>
<p>ii. What can regulatory authorities do to ensure that embryo or oocyte
donors are not receiving any inducement but fairly reciprocated for their
contributions to gene editing research?</p>
<p>iii. What can researchers and research institutions do to ensure that
the dignity and rights and privacy and confidentiality of individuals who
donate embryos or oocytes are protected?</p>
<p>d. Equitable Access and Allocation of Resources</p>
<p>4\. Gene editing technologies extend beyond discovering and developing
therapies, particularly for rare genetic disorders, severe diseases such
as cancer and treatment of infertility. These technologies can also be
used for enhancing specific traits. However, as with many new modalities
in medicine, gene editing technologies would give rise to concerns of inequitable
access by those who are in need but cannot afford them.</p>
<p>Ethical Considerations:</p>
<p>i. What are the ethical considerations in ensuring equitable access to
gene editing technologies?</p>
<p>ii. How do we ensure equitable access to gene editing technologies across
different socio-economic groups and regions?</p>
<p>iii. How can researchers and research institutions encourage more Asian
participation in clinical trials for gene editing technologies to ensure
inclusivity?</p>
<p><strong>e. Genetic Enhancement and the Effects on Society</strong>
</p>
<p>5 Recent advances have increased the possibility that gene editing can
also be used for purposes that go beyond therapies and medical interventions,
and the possible applications of gene editing technologies include genetic
enhancement in areas such as conferring resistance to diseases and enhancement
of physical attributes and cognitive abilities. Such potential clinical
applications of gene editing technologies raise several ethical issues.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. What are the ethical considerations involved in using gene editing
technologies for genetic enhancement?</p>
<p>ii. How might potential clinical applications of gene editing for genetic
enhancement impact future generations?</p>
<p>iii. Should we allow clinical applications of gene editing for genetic
enhancement?</p>
<p>iv. What can be done to ensure that gene editing technologies are used
responsibly and ethically?</p>

<p>### Footnotes</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Non-heritable gene editing involves making changes to somatic
cells, which include all cells in the body that are not involved in reproduction.
As a result, changes made to these cells cannot be inherited by any children
of the person receiving the treatment.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Solidarity reflects the willingness and moral obligations
of individuals to share the costs associated with research participation,
such as potential risks, in return for the common good.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Proportionality requires that the risk in any acceptable programme
of research, and the stringency of its regulation, should not be disproportionate
to any anticipated benefits.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>Responsible stewardship of science refers to the moral requirement
to be prudent about the resources and having oversight of all elements
responsibly, including planning, management, and decision-making in research
activities in the pursuit of any emerging field in biomedical research.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Mosaicism is a condition that occurs when a person has two
or more sets of cells that differ genetically from one another. For example,
a person with this condition might possess some cells that have 46 chromosomes
while other cells have 47 chromosomes.</p>
