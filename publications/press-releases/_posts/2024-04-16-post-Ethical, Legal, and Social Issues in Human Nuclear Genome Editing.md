<p><strong>PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL ISSUES IN HUMAN NUCLEAR GENOME EDITING</strong>
</p>
<p>1\. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) will conduct a public consultation
to seek views and feedback on the ethical, legal, and social issues in
Human Nuclear Genome Editing (HNGE). The online consultation will be conducted
from <strong>3 June 2024 to 31 July 2024</strong> and can be accessed from
&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/files/publications/consultation-papers/hnge.pdf/&quot;>here</a>" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/files/publications/consultation-papers/big-data-and-ai.pdf/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;</a>or
&lt;a href="<a href="https://go.gov.sg/feedback-bdai/&quot;>REACH" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/feedback-bdai/"&gt;REACH</a> Portal&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Challenges of Human Nuclear Genome Editing</strong>
</p>
<p>2\. .</p>
<p><strong>Aim of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>3\. Recognising these ethical challenges, the BAC has developed a public
consultation paper ‘Ethical, legal, and social issues in Human Nuclear
Genome Editing’ to discuss the ethical principles underpinning the use
of HNGE and selected use-cases in clinical research, such as respect for
persons, solidarity&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;, justice, proportionality&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;
and sustainability. Other ethical considerations are also discussed, including
integrity, transparency, accountability, consistency and stakeholder engagement.
The paper is intended to guide academics, researchers, healthcare professionals,
Clinical Ethics Committees (CECs) and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)
on the ethical use of HNGE. Other clinical or healthcare aspects will not
be covered within the scope of the paper.</p>
<p>4\. The report builds upon previous BAC reports and recommendations and
references relevant legislations such as the Personal Data Protection Act
(2012) and the Human Biomedical Research Act (2015), and complements other
big data and AI reports and ethical guidelines in Singapore to provide
guidance to decision-makers who work with big data in health and research,
codify good practice and support the safe growth of AI in biomedical and
healthcare research.</p>
<p>5\. The views of the public, academic, research, and healthcare institutions,
CECs, IRBs, professional bodies and societies, and other interested organisations
will assist the BAC in developing its recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>6\. The public consultation paper covers ethical issues arising from the
use of big data and AI in human biomedical research, such as responsible
data usage, data ownership, custodianship, and stewardship, data privacy,
accessibility and security, data anonymisation and other ethical considerations
and issues specific to AI. Please refer to <strong>Annex A</strong> for the
outline of key ethical questions and issues raised in the consultation
paper.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>7\. The public consultation will last for a period of two months from <strong>3 June 2024 to 31 July 2024.</strong> All
comments should be sent in by <strong>31 July 2024</strong>. Any comments
received after 31 July 2024 will not be considered.</p>
