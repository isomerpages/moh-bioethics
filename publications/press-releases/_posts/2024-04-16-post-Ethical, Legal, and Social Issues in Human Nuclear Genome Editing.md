<p><strong>PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL ISSUES IN HUMAN NUCLEAR GENOME EDITING</strong> 
</p>
<p>1\. The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) will conduct a public consultation
to seek views and feedback on the ethical, legal and social issues in Human
Nuclear Genome Editing (HNGE). The online consultation will be conducted
from <strong>2 May 2023 to 14 July 2023</strong> and can be accessed from
&lt;a href="<a href="https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/files/publications/consultation-papers/hnge.pdf/&quot;>here</a>" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/files/publications/consultation-papers/big-data-and-ai.pdf/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;</a>or
&lt;a href="<a href="https://go.gov.sg/feedback-bdai/&quot;>REACH" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/feedback-bdai/"&gt;REACH</a> Portal&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Challenges of Big Data and AI Use in Human Biomedical Research</strong>
</p>
<p>2\. With advances in information technology, data and computational analytics
in recent decades, the use of big data and AI in human biomedical research
is becoming increasingly important, enabling researchers and healthcare
professionals to analyse massive datasets, generate useful insights, and
enhance data-driven decisions. While the growing use of big data and AI
in biomedical research promises benefits, it also raises ethical issues
such as the need for protecting data privacy versus ensuring societal benefit;
the importance of obtaining informed consent and respecting the individual’s
rights and autonomy; and the extent of data security obligations with respect
to the value of data.</p>
<p><strong>Aim of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>3\. Recognising these ethical challenges, the BAC has developed a public
consultation paper ‘Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Use in Human Biomedical
Research’ to discuss the ethical principles underpinning the use of big
data and AI applications in human biomedical research and selected use-cases
in clinical research, such as respect for persons, solidarity&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;,
justice, proportionality&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; and sustainability.
Other ethical considerations are also discussed, including integrity, transparency,
accountability, consistency and stakeholder engagement. The paper is intended
to guide academics, researchers, healthcare professionals, Clinical Ethics
Committees (CECs) and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) on the ethical
use of big data and AI applications in human biomedical research. Other
clinical or healthcare aspects will not be covered within the scope of
the paper.</p>
<p>4\. The report builds upon previous BAC reports and recommendations and
references relevant legislations such as the Personal Data Protection Act
(2012) and the Human Biomedical Research Act (2015), and complements other
big data and AI reports and ethical guidelines in Singapore to provide
guidance to decision-makers who work with big data in health and research,
codify good practice and support the safe growth of AI in biomedical and
healthcare research.</p>
<p>5\. The views of the public, academic, research, and healthcare institutions,
CECs, IRBs, professional bodies and societies, and other interested organisations
will assist the BAC in developing its recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>6\. The public consultation paper covers ethical issues arising from the
use of big data and AI in human biomedical research, such as responsible
data usage, data ownership, custodianship, and stewardship, data privacy,
accessibility and security, data anonymisation and other ethical considerations
and issues specific to AI. Please refer to <strong>Annex A</strong> for the
outline of key ethical questions and issues raised in the consultation
paper.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>7\. The public consultation will last for a period of two months from <strong>2 May 2023 to 14 July 2023.</strong> All
comments should be sent in by <strong>14 July 2023</strong>. Any comments
received after 14 July 2023 will not be considered.</p>

<p><strong>ANNEX A</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>[Invitation To Comment] Public Consultation Paper: Ethical, Legal and Social Issues Arising from Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Human Biomedical Research.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>a. Responsible Data Usage</strong>
</p>
<p>1\. Responsible data usage ensures that data is used in a fair and transparent
manner without compromising data integrity. This protects individual privacy
and control of personal data. It also reduces the risk of discrimination
or injustice, or inaccurate research outcomes as a result of bias in AI
algorithms and the data used.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. How should human biomedical research data be managed and used responsibly
to avoid the risk of discrimination arising from participation or biases
in biomedical research?</p>
<p>ii. How should researchers or developers ensure that data fed into algorithms
is not biased and will not result in bias-driven outcomes when developing
AI algorithms?</p>
<p>iii. What is the ethical significance of ‘social licence’ in ensuring
responsible big data and AI use in biomedical research?</p>
<p><strong>b. Data Ownership, Custodianship, and Stewardship</strong>
</p>
<p>2\. Data ownership may be referred to as legal rights to have complete
control over data elements. While data owners have responsibilities to
ensure data security and accessibility, data custodianship is an assignment
of responsibility by the data owner to the custodian to manage the use
and access to the data through safe keeping of data (i.e., safe custody
and storage). Data stewardship complements data custodianship and involves
coordination with multiple parties to develop and implement policies for
managing and sharing data with responsible third parties in the interests
of biomedical research, as well as the training and educating of stakeholders
about the importance of responsible data management.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. How much control/right/power do individuals have after contributing
their data for biomedical research?</p>
<p>ii. What are the responsibilities of a data custodian?</p>
<p>iii. Should a person who had provided biological materials or data but
did not participate in the subsequent processing or analysis have intellectual
property rights in the data?</p>
<p>iv. How should large volumes of biomedical data shared across countries
in international research collaborations be managed?</p>
<p><strong>c. Data Privacy, Accessibility and Security</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>3\. Data privacy, accessibility and security frameworks will be necessary
to ensure that individuals’ personal data rights and interests are protected
through robust technical security systems while facilitating access to
the protected data by legitimate third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. How can providers/researchers ensure robust data security and proper
access control while maintaining data privacy?</p>
<p>ii. How can institutions or organisations managing data stored in multiple
on-site servers or cloud repositories ensure appropriate data accessibility?</p>
<p><strong>d. Data Anonymisation, De- and Re-identification of Data</strong>
</p>
<p>4\. Anonymisation, de- and re-identification of data are tools used in
biomedical research to enable data to be analysed while protecting the
data contributors’ privacy. As analyses involving big data and AI algorithms
in biomedical research rely increasingly on large volumes of personal,
health and medical data, conventional methods of de-identification and
anonymisation may no longer be adequate in protecting privacy.</p>
<p>5\. In Singapore, whole genomic data&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; is considered
identifiable personal data if linked to identifiers or indirect identifiers,
or on its own. It is not considered as personal data if the data is anonymised
and protected against re-identification. In our local context of healthcare
and biomedical sciences research where appropriate levels of data treatment&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;
and managerial controls&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt; are in place, whole genomic
data that has been de-identified is considered as anonymised data.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. Are current methods of anonymisation and de-identification still applicable
when large volumes of personal, health and medical data are used in big
data and AI research?</p>
<p>ii. Should genetic data be considered exceptional and treated differently
from other types of personal and health data?</p>
<p><strong>e. Revising Consent in the Arena of Big Data and AI</strong>
</p>
<p>6\. With advancements in technology, health information may be derived
from novel methods such as consumer platforms, social media, wearables
and sensors. Consent for mobile data collection is often carried out through
the internet of things (IoT) or edge computing, which is also known as
‘instant’ data or real-time data generated by sensors or users where data
can be processed more quickly and closer to where it is generated, allowing
real-time interaction with users. This is unlike cloud computing which
processes large datasets on centralised remote servers, making real-time
interaction difficult. In such scenarios, taking informed consent where
patients and individuals can understand clearly and sufficiently how their
data will be used in biomedical research becomes challenging.</p>
<p>7\. In cohort studies which typically involve longitudinal studies on
a group of individuals to study the development of diseases over long periods
of time, ensuring that the rights, interests, and welfare of research participants
are protected often entails obtaining consent from participants for usage
of data prior to their participation in research. However, obtaining consent
for the use of real-world data such as electronic health records, insurance
claims data, and data from health-monitoring devices can be more challenging,
because the data is often not collected primarily for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. What are the differences between consent taking for health and medical
data that are collected via various sources and novel methods?</p>
<p>ii. What are the differences between consent for usage of data between
cohort studies and that of real-world data?</p>
<p><strong>f. Responsibility to the Public in Data-Sharing for Research</strong>
</p>
<p>8\. Responsible data sharing can lead to research that benefits individuals,
communities, and society. The challenge lies in ensuring that data sharing
for research is conducted ethically, equitably, and with proper respect
for privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. How can the benefits of biomedical research be shared with participants
whose data is used?</p>
<p><strong>g. Ethical Considerations and Issues Specific to AI</strong>
</p>
<p>9\. Ethical principles that may apply to AI in biomedical research include
transparency&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;, explainability&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;,
and justifiability&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;. Other key considerations
include reliability and safety, accountability, human agency, equitable
access and model security to minimise potential harm to individuals and
parties involved in research projects.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
</p>
<p>i. What are the ethical considerations and responsibilities of biomedical
researchers and AI developers in complying with best standards to ensure
clinical safety of AI models?</p>
<p>ii. What are the ethical considerations in ensuring equitable access to
AI technologies in research?</p>

<p>### <strong>Footnotes</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;Solidarity reflects the willingness
and moral obligations of individuals to share the costs associated with
research participation, such as potential risks, in return for the common
good.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;Proportionality requires that the
methods or processes used in biomedical research are necessary and appropriate
in relation to the research intent and the range of public and private
interests at stake.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;Genomic data is the DNA data of organisms
that reveal how differences in DNA affect human health and disease. Whole
genomic data i.e., Whole Genome Sequence refers to the entire DNA of the
genome of an organism and Whole Exome Sequence refers to the protein coding
sequences from the genome.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;Examples of data treatment controls
include removal of direct identifiers such as national identification numbers,
names, and addresses, and generalisation of indirect identifiers such as
age and demographic data.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;Examples of managerial controls include
applying access controls such as physical, technical and/or administrative
measures to restrict access to only authorised parties, designing approval
processes and process controls that minimise risks of collusion, and prohibiting
unauthorised re-identification of individuals.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Transparency refers to the need to
openly inform and communicate with various stakeholders, at all stages
of the AI system’s development and implementation, how the AI system is
designed, developed, and applied.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;Explainability of AI systems refers
to the interpretability of input, output, and behaviour of the AI model
and how it contributes to the outcome of the prediction.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;An explainable AI model enables biomedical
researchers, users, and patients to understand the AI models’ predictions
and how the outcomes were derived.</p>
