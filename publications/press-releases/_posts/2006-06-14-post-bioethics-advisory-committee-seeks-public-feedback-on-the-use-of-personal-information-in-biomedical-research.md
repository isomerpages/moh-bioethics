<p><strong>Consultation Paper distributed to 70 religious, professional and scientific organisations, and healthcare and research institutions in Singapore to seek their views</strong>
</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) has thoroughly
examined the ethical, legal and social issues arising from the use of personal
information in biomedical research. This was achieved by studying various
policies and guidelines adopted in other leading jurisdictions and recommendations
made by national and international organisations. Local and international
experts were also consulted.</p>
<p>The BAC has prepared a Consultation Paper entitled “The Use of Personal
Information in Biomedical Research”. Key ethical, legal and social issues
covered in this paper are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Legal protection of personal information in biomedical research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtaining informed consent for biomedical research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethical considerations provided by the BAC include:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy and confidentiality considerations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to personal information by third parties such as employers and
insurers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Consultation Paper proposes 13 recommendations to address these issues.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Terry Kaan, Chairman of the Human Genetics Subcommittee
says: “For biomedical research to develop in Singapore, it is essential
for researchers to have access to medical information and other kinds of
personal information. I think most people are supportive of research. Having
clear rules about how such information may be used, and ensuring that there
are appropriate safeguards in place for the protection of such information
will encourage people to participate and help in such research in the confidence
that their privacy and the confidentiality of their private information
will be protected. I think we also need to consider establishing laws to
support the work of disease registries, which are crucial in national health
care planning and policy, and in advancing treatment for the diseases that
affect us most here in Singapore. The development of a legal privacy protection
regime will help reinforce public confidence in privacy safeguards, and
allow registries to function properly. This will bring us in line with
the personal information protection regimes of most major scientific jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>BAC Chairman, Professor Lim Pin agrees with Associate Professor Kaan,
adding: “It should be stressed that a legal privacy protection regime is
to facilitate biomedical research, and not to impede its progress. A legal
privacy protection regime will help prevent possible ethical lapses regarding
privacy and confidentiality from occurring and thus safeguard and promote
Singapore’s reputation as a responsible and safe country for carrying out
biomedical research. This will bring about multiple benefits such as the
possibility of collaboration with other countries for biomedical research.”</p>
<p>The Consultation Paper will be distributed to 70 organisations and institutions
seeking their views on the issues discussed and the recommendations proposed.
The BAC also welcomes comments from the public. Those interested in providing
their views could obtain a copy of the Consultation Paper at www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg
and should send their responses by 31 July 2006 to:</p>
<p>Email:</p>
<p>All comments received will be carefully considered before the final recommendations
are made to the Steering Committee on Life Sciences. The BAC plans to publish
all written responses received, unless it receives a request to consider
responses confidential.</p>
<p><strong>List of Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The Legal Protection of Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommendation 1
<br>We recommend that the relevant authorities consider establishing a legal
framework for the use of personal information in biomedical research.</p>
<p><strong>Informed Consent</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommendation 2
<br>Specific consent should be obtained when research involves identifiable
personal information or tissue samples. General consent may be obtained
for subsequent research involving the use of de-identified information
or remnant tissue. The information to be provided to the individual when
taking consent should depend on the sensitivity of the information and
the risk of harm.</p>
<p><strong>Epidemiological Research and Public Health Research</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommendation 3
<br>We recommend that the relevant authorities clarify the legal basis for
the disclosure of medical information to disease registries by health care
institutions and physicians; and establish mechanisms enabling the registries
and healthcare institutions to increase the accessibility of personal information
for research that can significantly advance public welfare, while safeguarding
privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Recommendation 4
<br>We recommend that the relevant authorities consider establishing legal
mechanisms to facilitate the use of personal information in registries,
databases, and medical records for epidemiological research and public
health research. These mechanisms should also ensure that there is minimal
risk to individual privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Audit</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommendation 5
<br>We recommend that the relevant authorities consider legal provisions necessary
to ensure that the potentially increased scope of clinical audits does
not violate medical confidentiality and to assure the public that privacy
and confidentiality interests in personal information will be safeguarded.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Considerations about Consent</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommendation 6
<br>We recommend that IRBs, when reviewing research, ensure that any concerns
in regard to vulnerable persons are appropriately addressed.</p>
<p>Recommendation 7
<br>Research participants should be allowed to withdraw their consent to participate
in a research at any time without explanation and without prejudice. They
should be assured that upon withdrawal their personal information and/or
tissue samples will either be destroyed or irreversibly de-identified.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy and Confidentiality</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommendation 8
<br>Personal information should be de-identified as far and as early as possible
and should be stored or transferred as de-identified information.</p>
<p>Recommendation 9
<br>Researchers should not attempt to identify an individual from de-identified
information as it is a serious breach of ethics to do so.</p>
<p>Recommendation 10
<br>Irreversibly de-identified personal information generally need not be
subject to privacy and confidentiality requirements.</p>
<p>Recommendation 11
<br>When reversibly de-identified information is used for research, IRBs should
consider the adequacy of the extent and means of the de-identification
in proportion to the risk. Should a person be identified from de-identified
information, the person should still enjoy confidentiality and privacy
entitlements.</p>
<p>Recommendation 12
<br>The ethical principle of confidentiality should apply to the use of personal
information from medical or public registries. Confidentiality safeguards
should be commensurate with the potential risk of harm from inadvertent
disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Medical Information by Employers and Insurers</strong>
</p>
<p>Recommendation 13
<br>We recommend that the government consider implementing a moratorium on
the use of predictive genetic information for insurance purposes and appoint
an authority to consider long-term implications of the accessibility of
predictive genetic test results by employers and the insurance industry
and to monitor developments in this area.</p>

<h3><strong>About the BAC</strong></h3>
<p>The BAC was established by the Government in December 2000 to address
the ethical, legal and social issues arising from human biomedical research
and its applications. It develops and recommends policies on these issues,
with the aim of protecting the rights and welfare of individuals, while
allowing the biomedical sciences to develop and realise its full potential
for the benefit of mankind.</p>
