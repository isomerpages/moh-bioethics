**Interim Report on Mitochondrial Genome Replacement Technology**

*27 October 2021*

Mitochondrial diseases are rare diseases that interfere with a person’s mitochondrial functions which are frequently debilitating. Mitochondrial Genome Replacement Technology (MGRT) offers the possibility of carrier mothers to have genetically related children without the transmission of mitochondrial diseases.

In 2005, the Genetic Testing and Genetic Research Report developed by the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC), recommended not to allow clinical germline genetic modification until evidence regarding the safety and clinical efficacy of MGRT have been established. In light of global interest in MGRT, the BAC embarked on an in-depth survey of the state of the art, regulatory policies in other jurisdictions, obtained consensus views of professional bodies, and closely monitored instances when these techniques were performed.

This interim report presents the BAC’s position on whether clinical application of mitochondrial genome replacement techniques should be permitted in Singapore, given the current state of MGRT research and public feedback. The BAC will continue to monitor developments and revisit the issue when further scientific evidence and clinical experience become available.
