**Ethics Guidelines for Human Biomedical Research 2021 Revised** <br>
*27 October 2021*

BAC's first edition of *Ethics Guidelines for Human Biomedical Research* was published in 2015. The objective of this publication was to be a one-stop resource for researchers and members of ethics committees, or any interested individual seeking guidance on best practices for the ethical conduct of human biomedical research in Singapore.

Since then, the biomedical sciences and research in Singapore has advanced rapidly, with legislation, guidelines and directives being modified to account for and regulate these new research endeavors.

2021 was thus a suitable year for BAC to conduct a timely review of the 2015 *Guidelines*. The updated 2021 *Guidelines* aims to remain a relevant and reliable one-stop resource for researchers and research institutions seeking to conduct human biomedical research in Singapore, or for individuals interested in the topic of bioethics.

An electronic copy of the publication is available here for download in A4 and A5.
