**Neuroscience Research Report** <br>
*27 October 2021*

With the increasing presence of neurological and psychiatric disorders worldwide, neuroscience research has become a priority in many countries. Singapore is no exception. Given our aging population and high-paced urban living environment, the prevalence of aging-associated neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders, is expected to increase. Finding effective treatments for such neurological disorders through research has become a global effort, with many countries involved.

However, new neurotechnologies to study and modify the brain have raised concerns about the potential impact of neuroscience research on the rights and welfare of individual research subjects and patients in the present and future.

Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) embarked on this project to study the potential ethical, legal and social issues arising from neuroscience research. Through this review, the BAC recognised that many of the ethical challenges could already be addressed by BACâ€™s existing ethics recommendations and research governance frameworks including the Human Biomedical Research Act 2015 and its subsidiary legislation.
