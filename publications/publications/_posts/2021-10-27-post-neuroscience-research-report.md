**Neuroscience Research Report** <br>
*27 October 2021*

With the increasing presence of neurological and psychiatric disorders worldwide, neuroscience research has become a priority in many countries. Singapore is no exception. Given our aging population and high-paced urban living environment, the prevalence of aging-associated neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders, is expected to increase. Finding effective treatments for such neurological disorders has become a global research effort.

Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) embarked on this project to study the potential ethical, legal and social issues arising from neuroscience research.
