**Ethics Guidelines for Human Biomedical Research 2021 Revised** <br>
*27 October 2021*

The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) published the first edition of *Ethics Guidelines for Human Biomedical Research (Guidelines)* in 2015. The objective of this publication was to be a one-stop resource for researchers and members of ethics committees, or any interested individual seeking guidance on best practices for the ethical conduct of human biomedical research in Singapore.

Since then, the biomedical sciences in Singapore have advanced rapidly, with legislation, guidelines and directives being developed or updated to keep abreast with the latest developments in human biomedical research.

The BACâ€™s 20th Anniversary Event held in June 2021 provided an opportunity for the BAC to review its past work and recommendations since its establishment in 2000.  The updated 2021 *Guidelines* aims to remain a current, relevant and reliable one-stop resource for researchers and research institutions seeking to conduct human biomedical research in Singapore, or for individuals interested in the topic of bioethics.
