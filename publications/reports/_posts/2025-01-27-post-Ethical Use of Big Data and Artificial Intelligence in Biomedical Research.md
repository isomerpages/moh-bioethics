<p><strong>Report: Ethical Use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Research</strong>
</p>
<p><em>27 January 2025</em>
</p>
<p>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) has released a new advisory report
on the ‘Ethical Use of Big Data And Artificial Intelligence (AI) In Biomedical
Research’. This report is developed by the Big Data and AI Review Group,
comprising experts from various disciplines. It aims to discuss the ethical,
legal, and social issues arising from the use of Big Data and AI in human
biomedical research, and will guide academics, healthcare professionals,
researchers, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) on the ethical use
of Big Data and AI in biomedical research.</p>
<p>With rapid advancements in healthcare technologies, the increasing use
of Big Data and AI has opened new frontiers and possibilities for human
biomedical research. The use of Big Data and AI methodologies has allowed
for the processing and analysis of large amounts of data that traditional
methodologies cannot handle and provides researchers with access to vast
amounts of information that were previously inaccessible.</p>
<p>As we navigate the era of exponential data growth and technological innovation,
it is essential for us to recognise the ethical, legal, and societal implications
arising from the use of Big Data and AI in human biomedical research. &nbsp;Therefore,
the responsible and ethical use of these technologies is paramount as we
strive to unlock new insights, develop innovative therapies, and improve
healthcare outcomes for individuals and society.</p>
<p>The advisory report covers topics that discuss the nature of Big Data,
the applications of Big Data and AI in biomedical research, associated
challenges, as well as the corresponding benefits, risks, and ethical considerations.
The report discusses the general ethical principles guiding the use of
Big Data and AI in biomedical research in Singapore. These principles encompass
(i) respect for persons; (ii) solidarity; (iii) justice; (iv) proportionality;
(v) sustainability; (vi) integrity, transparency, and accountability; (vii)
consistency; and (viii) stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p>The report also addresses ethical concerns related to the utilisation
of Big Data and AI in human biomedical research, including responsible
data usage, data ownership, custodianship, stewardship, data privacy, accessibility,
security, data anonymisation, and ethical considerations specific to AI.</p>
<p>The key recommendations are summarised as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Researchers should provide participants with comprehensive information
about the purpose, nature, potential risks and benefits of the research,
and relevant information about the AI system (e.g., source and credibility
of the data used to train the AI models, how the AI works, its reliability
and limits, current and potential bias, human versus machine roles and
responsibilities, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For international research collaborations, researchers should include
plans for data sharing or dissemination in their research proposals, where
appropriate and only share data with countries which have similar ethical
guidelines. This will enable participants to be fully aware of the parties
accessing their data and the implications for their privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research institutions should put in place a data governance framework
and/or data management plan specifically to govern data sharing between
parties and particularly when public-private partnerships are concerned.
Appropriate audit mechanisms and processes should be put in place to encourage
data integrity and transparency of the framework and/or data management
plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When reviewing research protocols, IRBs have the responsibility to encourage
inclusion of adequate provisions protecting the privacy of research participants
and confidentiality of data in the research plan. This includes assessing
the necessary precautions taken in reducing the risk of individual re-identification
and ensuring responsible sharing of research data. Where relevant, consent
processes should be properly carried out and participants should be adequately
informed of research study details and possible future uses of data in
other research involving Big Data and AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IRBs should ensure that institutions establish appropriate governance
frameworks and mechanisms for data sharing that account for transparency
while protecting privacy and rights of individual participants. Such mechanisms
may extend to including monitoring compliance with policies and regulations
for ‘data sharing’ in research, and managing datasets that are not governed
by any system for data sharing. There should be reasonable accommodation
for secondary use of data while ensuring participants’ data privacy are
protected.</p>
