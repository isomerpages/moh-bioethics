**Neuroscience Research Report** <br>
*27 October 2021*

With increasing prevalence of neurological and psychiatric disorders globally, neuroscience research has become a priority in Singapore and many other countries. Research efforts in the development of novel neurotechnologies and effective treatments for such disorders have therefore become increasingly important.

However, as the brain is the seat of oneâ€™s mind and underlies our thoughts, emotions and behaviours, new neurotechnologies that study and modify the brain have raised concerns about the potential impact of neuroscience research on the rights and welfare of individual research subjects and patients in the present and future.

The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) embarked on this project to study the potential ethical, legal and social issues arising from neuroscience research.
